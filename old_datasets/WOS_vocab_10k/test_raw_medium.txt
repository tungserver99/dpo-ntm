group identification predicts adherence to a group's norms values beliefs and behaviors the ability to accurately perceive another's degree of group identification may be important for predicting the other's beliefs and actions in two studies we examine friends' accuracy and bias in rating identification with social categories friends were asked to rate one another's and their own identification with state studies 1 and 2 national and global citizen study 2 social identities across both studies friends were shown to be both accurate and biased in rating one another's identification thus although friends may project identification onto a friend ie bias friends are also able to accurately predict one another's degree of connection to social groups furthermore friends' greater frequency of contact was found to increase accuracy in prediction together the results provide initial evidence for future research examining person perception and intergroup interactions
beaver slide is near 1778km 1105mi on the dalton highway and the road gradient is approximately 11% built on a hill side each year soft spots also commonly named as frost boils were observed starting from late april and lasting for the entire summer the frost boils have resulted in an extremely unsafe driving condition and frequent accident occurrences conventional repair methods cannot effectively solve this issue a newly developed geotextile which has high specific surface area was installed in the selected test section to mitigate the frostboil issue in august 2010 this type of geotextile can provide high wettability and relatively high suction capillary force consequently be able to laterally transport water a highdirectional transmissivity under unsaturated conditions test results over the initial 2years had proved the effectiveness of the geotextile to alleviate frost heave and the subsequent thawweakening issue however there were still some concerns regarding its longterm performance such as clogging of the microscopic drainage channels and mechanical failures the data collected during the past 5 years were used to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the wicking fabric a scanning electron microscope was used to explore the interaction between the wicking fabric and in situ soils and to determine the condition of the fabric 5 years after the installation c 2016 american society of civil engineers
social cognition refers to the ability to use social cues to infer the meaning and intentions behind the behaviour of others in order to respond in a socially adaptive manner it is increasingly recognised that disorders of social cognition including problems with emotion perception theory of mind conversational inference morality judgements decision making and social inhibition characterise many developmental and psychiatric disorders and are highly relevant to many with acquired brain injuries or diseases especially the frontotemporal dementias this review provides an introduction and overview of the papers in this special edition on social cognition and places these in the context of other recent research in doing so several current issues in the clinical management of social cognition are delineated given that social cognition seems to be a sensitive predictor of psychosocial function the assessment of social cognition is seen by many clinicians to be important although which profession is responsible is yet to be resolved issues in how social cognition are assessed are discussed including the importance of context to social cognition its interactive nature and the need to recognise influences such as family upbringing gender and emotional state on social cognitive performance there also needs to be development of tests that address all aspects of social cognition including decision making and inhibition finally this review discusses intervention research interventions are especially well developed in relation to schizophrenia and less well developed in brain injury these appear to be generally effective although treatments for emotional selfawareness are yet to be developed
to compensate for the limitations of optical remote sensing when restricted by cloud cover it is worth exploring how to detect cyanobacterial blooms using synthetic aperture radar sar which can penetrate clouds a satelliteground synchronous experiment was conducted in lake taihu the third largest freshwater lake in china a lipopeptide biosurfactant was detected in the algal scum layer with an average content of 18 g/l the viscosity 141 to 332 mpa s of the scum was significantly higher than that of scumfree water the surface tension of the algal scum decreased by 125% and the sar microwave backscatter was reduced by 73 db this indicated that the cyanobacterial scum could effectively attenuate capillary waves and appear as dark patches in sar images sar has the potential to be developed as a tool for the remote sensing of algal scum in lake waters c 2017 society of photooptical instrumentation engineers spie
the viewpoints of brazilian opinion leaders regarding cancer are not yet well defined examining public perceptions of three segments of society through a qualitative study may provide clues to understanding the negative view that the population still has about the disease journalists scientists and teachers participated in discussions in six focus group sessions the findings were studied using the content analysis method showing similar elements among these professionals regardless of area of operation we identified a negative view that may be contributing to or mirroring the vision of society that associates the illness with death and suffering although these opinion leaders believe they are able to filter certain negative aspects of media dissemination about cancer when the disease affects them personally the feeling of despair resembles common sense words such as cure are viewed with prejudice on the other hand a morbid approach arouses interest on the subject it was also noted that the disclosure of a celebrity with cancer stands out as a decoy in the consumption of news such distortions may support actions that enhance communication about cancer structured on pillars such as prevention early diagnosis and cure
digital hemispherical photography is a simple nondestructive method for estimating canopy biophysical parameters for ecological applications and validation of remote sensing products determination of optimum and repeatable acquisition procedures is well documented in the literature but so far this has not focused on evaluating the levelling procedure used to align the camera in this paper the standard recommendation that tripod levelling is a necessity is tested by comparing it with a handlevelled procedure the results show that the average difference between the two procedures is < 2% for effective plant area index and < 1% for gap fraction at the valeri plot scale which generally falls within the variance users implementing the handlevelled technique can expect large reductions in data acquisition time allowing many more samples to be collected without compromising the overall quality of the data retrieved c 2017 the authors published by elsevier bv
a common assumption about implicit measures is that they reflect early experiences whereas explicit measures are assumed to reflect recent experiences this assumption subsumes two distinct hypotheses: a implicit measures are more resistant to situationally induced changes than explicit measures; b individual differences on implicit measures are more stable over time than individual differences on explicit measures although the first hypothesis has been the subject of numerous studies the second hypothesis has received relatively little attention the current research addressed the second hypothesis in two longitudinal studies that compared the temporal stability of individual differences on implicit and explicit measures in three content domains selfconcept racial attitudes political attitudes in both studies implicit measures showed significantly lower stability over time weighted average r 54 than conceptually corresponding explicit measures weighted average r 75 despite comparable estimates of internal consistency implications for theories of implicit social cognition and interpretations of implicit and explicit measures are discussed
recent forecasts suggest that african countries must triple their current electricity generation by 2030 our multicriteria assessment of wind and solar potential for large regions of africa shows how economically competitive and lowenvironmentalimpact renewable resources can significantly contribute to meeting this demand we created the multicriteria analysis for planning renewable energy mapre framework to map and characterize solar and wind energy zones in 21 countries in the southern african power pool sapp and the eastern africa power pool eapp and find that potential is several times greater than demand in many countries significant fractions of demand can be quickly served with noregrets optionsor zones that are lowcost lowenvironmental impact and highly accessible because noregrets options are spatially heterogeneous international interconnections are necessary to help achieve lowcarbon development for the region as a whole and interconnections that support the best renewable options may differ from those planned for hydropower expansion additionally interconnections and selecting wind sites to match demand reduce the need for sappwide conventional generation capacity by 95% in a highwind scenario resulting in a 620% cost savings depending on the avoided conventional technology strategic selection of lowimpact and accessible zones is more cost effective with interconnections compared with solutions without interconnections overall results are robust to multiple load growth scenarios together results show that multicriteria site selection and deliberate planning of interconnections may significantly increase the economic and environmental competitiveness of renewable alternatives relative to conventional generation
building on psychological research linking essentialist beliefs about human differences with prejudice we test whether lay belief in the biological basis of political ideology is associated with political intolerance and social avoidance in two studies of american adults study 1: n 288 study 2: n 164 we find that belief in the biological basis of political views is associated with greater intolerance and social avoidance of ideologically dissimilar others the association is substantively large and robust to demographic religious and political control variables these findings stand in contrast to some theoretical expectations that biological attributions for political ideology are associated with tolerance we conclude that biological lay theories are especially likely to be correlated with prejudice in the political arena where social identities tend to be salient and linked to intergroup competition and animosity
the present contribution is a significant extension of the work by kelbin et al j fluid mech vol 721 2013 pp 340366 as a new timedependent helical coordinate system has been introduced for this lie symmetry methods have been employed such that the spatial dependence of the originally three independent variables is reduced by one and the remaining variables are: the cylindrical radius r and the time dependent helical variable xi z/alpha t + b phi b const and time t the variables z and pi are the usual cylindrical coordinates and alpha t is an arbitrary function of time t assuming alpha const we retain the classical helically symmetric case using this and imposing helical invariance onto the equation of motion leads to a helically symmetric system of euler and navierstokes equations with a timedependent pitch alpha t which may be varied arbitrarily and which is explicitly contained in all of the latter equations this has been conducted both for primitive variables as well as for the vorticity formulation hence a significantly extended set of helically invariant flows may be considered which may be altered by an external timedependent strain along the axis of the helix finally we sought new conservation laws which can be found from the helically invariant euler and navierstokes equations derived herein most of these new conservation laws are considerable extensions of existing conservation laws for helical flows at a constant pitch interestingly enough certain classical conservation laws do not admit extensions in the new timedependent coordinate system

chronic exposure to arsenic affects more than 200 million people worldwide and has been associated with many adverse health effects including cancer in several organs there is accumulating evidence that arsenic biotransformation a step in the elimination of arsenic from the human body can induce changes at a genetic and epigenetic level leading to carcinogenesis at the genetic level arsenic interferes with key cellular processes such as dna damagerepair and chromosomal structure leading to genomic instability at the epigenetic level arsenic places a high demand on the cellular methyl pool leading to global hypomethylation and hypermethylation of specific gene promoters these arsenicassociated dna alterations result in the deregulation of both oncogenic and tumoursuppressive genes furthermore recent reports have implicated aberrant expression of noncoding rnas and the consequential disruption of signaling pathways in the context of arsenicinduced carcinogenesis this article provides an overview of the oncogenomic anomalies associated with arsenic exposure and conveys the importance of noncoding rnas in the arsenicinduced carcinogenic process
though many of people's impressions about each other stem from qualities that are obvious or apparent social perceptions also rely on a variety of subtle cues that guide judgment and behavior for example emerging work has increasingly elucidated the conditions and means by which individuals' accuracy in judging others' sexual orientation is better than chance we discuss these here focusing on four domains from which people draw cues to accurately perceive sexual orientation: how people adorn themselves adornment how they move actions how they sound acoustics and how they look appearance moreover we describe how certain factors such as one's own sexual orientation can constrain or facilitate this accuracy and describe the various negative social and occupational consequences that may result from cues that someone is gay or straight
recent development in network technology can realize the control of a remote plant by a digital controller however there is a delay caused by data transmission of control inputs and outputs the delay degrades the control performance without taking it into consideration in general it is a difficult problem to identify the delay beforehand we also assume that the plant's parameters have uncertainty to solve the problem we use reinforcement learning to achieve optimal digital control first we consider state feedback control next we consider the case where the plant's outputs are observed and apply reinforcement learning to output feedback control finally we demonstrate by simulation that the proposed control method can search for the optimal gain and that it can adapt to the change of the delay

the highdimensional data space generated by hyperspectral sensors introduces challenges for the conventional data analysis techniques popular dimensionality reduction techniques usually assume a gaussian distribution which may not be in accordance with real life metric learning methods which explore the global data structure of the labeled training samples have proved to be very efficient in hyperspectral fields however we can go further by utilizing locally adaptive decision constraints for the labeled training samples per class to obtain an even better performance in this paper we present the locally adaptive dimensionality reduction metric learning ladrml method for hyperspectral image classification the aims of the presented method are: 1 first to utilize the limited training samples to reduce the dimensionality of data without a certain distribution hypothesis; and 2 second to better handle data with complex distributions by the use of locally adaptive decision constraints which can assess the similarity between a pair of samples based on the distance changes before and after metric learning the experimental results obtained with a number of challenging hyperspectral image datasets demonstrate that the proposed ladrml algorithm outperforms the stateoftheart dimensionality reduction and metric learning methods
imagination pushes humanity well beyond its natural biological capacities an approach of coevolution between molecular biology and behaviour is thus required to explain these combined processes technological performances define spiritual conquests and formulas whose sole function is cultural humanity operates according to intentional social modes defined by the group but these immediately become conditions for their own evolution these choices are the motor for the history of humanity and thus humanity can itself choose its own path anatomic modernisation is only a distant reflection of bipedalism but freeing the hands leads to the development of abstract thought the relationship between anatomy and awareness allows infinite variations in the harmonious adaptation to nature animals and other societies in europe humanity arrived in abrupt bursts because it was the result of external evolution continuous and distant dispersed across asia by its unceasing audacity humanity combats biological determinism imposing moral rules or imperatives the balance between biology and culture is reflected in the rules for sharing food: the biological life itself is coded by social sharing these systems take on ternary values as soon as they include animal behaviours built shelters integrate societies with the cosmos because they delimit cultural spaces within natural chaos mastery of cognitive mechanisms gives humanity an entirely new responsibility that of being able to define its destiny our united disciplines are transformed into ethical requirements c 2016 published by elsevier masson sas on behalf of academie des sciences
objectives: to measure early retirement due to selfreported rheumatic diseases rds and to estimate the respective indirect costs and years of working life lost ywll methods: we used individual level data from the national crosssectional population based epireumapt study september 2011 december 2013 where 10 661 inhabitants were randomly surveyed in order to capture and characterize all cases of rd within a representative sample of the portuguese population in this analysis we used all participants aged between 50 and 64 years near the official retirement age a national database was used to calculate productivity values by gender age and region using the human capital approach ywll were estimated as the difference between each participant's current age and the respective retirement age while the potential years of working life lost pywll were given by the difference between official and actual retirement ages we also calculated the percentage of time in inactivity inactivity ratio ywll/active agerange 1564 years old results: 299% of the portuguese population with ages between 50 and 64 years were retired with 131% selfreporting retirement due to rd the estimated annual indirect cost following premature retirement attributed to rd was sic 910 million sic 555 per capita; sic 1625 per selfreported rd patient and sic 13 592 per early retiree due to rd females contributed with 84% for these costs sic 766 million; sic 882 per capita vs sic 187 from males we observed a total number of 389 939 accumulated ywll 228 per 1000 inhabitants and 684 960 pywll 401 per 1000 inhabitants the mean ywll and pywll inactivity ratios were 12% and 21% respectively rd patients with higher values of disability have the highest risk of early retirement conclusions: early retirement attributed to selfreported rd amounts to approximately 05% of the national gross domestic product gdp in 2013 due to large ywll both the public health concern and the economic impact highlight the need to prioritize investments in health and social protection policies targeting patients with rheumatic conditions c 2016 the royal society for public health published by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the evolution of the human eye's unique high contrast morphology allows people to communicate with a simple look yet overt looking is not always preferred in social situations do covert shifts in attention those that occur without a concomitant shift of the eyes or head support this need? in the present field study we discretely recorded pedestrians' looks to a confederate who performed an action raising his hand to the side of his head and saying 'hey' into a phone private action or raising his hand to the side of his head in greeting ie a static wave and saying 'hey' public action critically pedestrians were not looking at the confederate at the start of the action despite this pedestrians looked more in response to the public action wave than private action phone we argue that the observed difference in looking responses must be due to pedestrians first attending to the confederate covertly in order to assess the intention of his action and only signaling this attention with a look when socially appropriate eg to respond to a public action though the functional utility of covert attention has rarely been considered outside of controlled laboratory tasks these results provide the first demonstration that covert attention plays a critical role in guiding appropriate social looking behaviour c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
the concept of social exclusion has recently gained more attention in the context of online social interactions however there is only little data regarding the impact of virtual social exclusion on subsequent reallife social behaviors thus this study set out to examine a virtual version of the common social exclusion scenario the cyberballparadigm williams & jarvis 2006 and test for behavioral consequences in a sample of 45 students both the virtual characters' agency and the experience of social presence were controlled for findings indicate that ostracized individuals show less prosocial behavior in a helping task and keep more seating distance to a confederate than included participants also virtual social exclusion constitutes a significant threat to fundamental human needs like social control selfesteem and belonging and causes an increase in uncertainty sadness and anger as well as a decrease in happiness avatars and agents seemed to equally endanger human needs and lead to the same seating distance however avatar excluded persons also had higher levels of sadness and were less helpful than avatar included persons who in turn were more confident thus while the media equation concept nass & moon 2000 holds true for the immediate reaction to social exclusion ie avatars and agents equally threaten fundamental needs the delayed emotional and behavioral reactions differ for avatars and agents possibly because they are preceded by cognitive evaluation cf temporal needthreat model; williams 2009 implications of these findings for everyday online social interactions ie in mmorpg5 are discussed c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

perceived vulnerability to disease may be defined as the beliefs about personal susceptibility to the transmission of infectious diseases and the emotional discomfort associated with the potential disease transmission to evaluate these beliefs the perceived vulnerability to disease scale pvd has been used in most studies the aim of study 1 was to validate the pvd questionnaire to the spanish population the sample was made up of 744 university students from all over spain confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the items on the short version of the questionnaire corresponding to an interrelated twofactor model perceived infectability and germ aversion showed the best fit of all the tested models in study 2 scales to measure antifat attitudes disgust and negative attitudes towards aids were used to analyse the criterion validity of the pvd questionnaire the sample was made up of 434 university students it was found that germ aversion was positively related with antifat attitudes disgust and negative attitudes towards aids in light of these results we conclude that the short version of the questionnaire has good psychometric properties and can be used by the scientific community to measure perceived vulnerability to disease
geotextile tubes have been widely used for the dewatering of high water content fine sediments fine sediments include lake sediments organic soils and coal combustion products which generally have low shear strength several researchers have emphasized the effect of the retained sediment filter cake properties on dewatering performance and stability of the geotextile tubes maintaining retained sediment properties in particular permeability and shear strength allows for faster dewatering time better retention of sediments and improved stability of the geotextile tubes during multiple filling stages and during the tube stacking process several studies have shown that the use of synthetic fibers can increase the shear strength of sand silt and clays however the use of fibers to improve the strength of retained sediments in geotextile tubes has not been explored in this study three synthetic fibers varying in length and diameter were used to evaluate the effect of fibers on the dewatering performance and shear strength of the fine sediments a cationic polyacrylamide flocculant was used as an optimum conditioner for the selected sediment the fibers were mixed with the flocculant conditioned slurry at 025 05 1 and 2% fiber concentration by mass of the dry solids the effect of fibers on the undrained shear strength of the dewatered sediments was evaluated using a lab vane test fall cone test and undrained unconsolidated triaxial test jar tests and pressure filtration tests were also conducted to evaluate the effect of fiber on the required flocculant dosage and on the dewatering performance based on the results of this study 05% of f1 fiber type was found to be the optimum fiber concentration yielding an approximately 100% increase in undrained shear strength it was also found that the diameter and length of the fibers play a significant role in altering the undrained shear strength of the tested sediments the relatively short 6 mm and thick 38 mu m fiber did not yield an increase in shear strength for all the tested fiber concentrations whereas thin fibers 9 mu m of similar length increased the shear strength by 100% furthermore it was found that the use of fibers at any concentration decreases the required optimum doses of flocculant by about 15% and increases the dewatering rate of the effluents by about 50%

organization members who engage in moral objection by taking a principled stand against ethically questionable activities help to prevent such activities from persisting unfortunately research suggests that they also may be perceived as less warm ie pleasant nice than members who comply with ethically questionable procedures in this article we draw on role theory to explore how legitimate power influences observers' responses to moral objection we argue that individuals expect those high in legitimate power to engage in moral objection but expect those low in legitimate power to comply with ethically questionable practices we further propose that these contrasting role expectations influence the extent to which moral objectors are perceived as warm and subjected to social sanctions ie insults pressure unfriendly behavior we test our predictions with 3 experiments study 1 which draws on participants' prior workplace experiences supports the first section of our mediated moderation model in which the negative association between an actor's moral objection vs compliance and observers' warmth perceptions is weaker when the actor is high rather than low in legitimate power and this effect is mediated by observers' met role expectations study 2 an online experiment featuring a biased hiring task reveals that the warmth perceptions fostered by the behavior x legitimate power interaction influence observers' social sanctioning intentions finally study 3 a laboratory experiment which exposes participants to unethical behavior in a virtual team task replicates study 2's findings and extends the results to actual as well as intended social sanctions
multiproxy signature is a variant of proxy signature which allows that a delegator original signer may delegate his signing rights to many proxy signers comparing with proxy signatures multiproxy signatures can effectively prevent that some of proxy signers abuse signing rights also with the rapid development of identitybased cryptography identitybased multiproxy signature ibmps schemes have been proposed comparing with proxy signature based on public key cryptography ibmps can simplify key management and be used for more applications presently many identitybased multiproxy signature schemes have been proposed but most of them are constructed in the random oracle model also the existing security model for identitybased multiproxy signature is not enough complete according to the boldyreva et al's work in this paper we present a framework for ibmps on n + 1 users n is the number of proxy signers participating in signing and show a detailed security model for ibmps under our framework we present an identitybased multiproxy signature scheme in the standard model comparing with other identitybased multiproxy signature schemes the proposed scheme has more complete security

theorists of post capitalism have recently argued for a more or less inevitable end to capitalism they assume that private accumulation is systematically blocked by the inability of capitalist corporations to create revenues by setting prices as they lose control over the reproduction of their commodities and that in this process capitalist labour will eventually disappear drawing on a case study of amazon and thoughts on the policies of other leading digital corporations we challenge these assumptions key corporate players of digitization are trying to become powerful monopolies and have partly succeeded in doing so using the network effects and scaling opportunities of digital goods and building sociotechnical ecosystems these strategies have led to the development of in part isomorphic structures hence creating a situation of oligopolistic market competition we draw on basic assumptions of monopoly capital theory to argue that in this situation labour process rationalization becomes key to the corporation's competitive strategies we see the expansion of digital control and the organizational structures applied by key corporate players of the digital economy as evidence for the expansion of capitalist labour not its reduction
wood contains a large amount of air even in functional xylem air embolisms in the xylem affect water transport and can determine plant growth and survival embolisms are usually estimated with laborious hydraulic methods which can be prone to several artefacts here we describe a new method for estimating embolisms that is based on air flow measurements of entire branches to calculate the amount of air flowing out of the branch a vacuum was applied to the cut bases of branches under different water potentials we first investigated the source of air by determining whether it came from inside or outside the branch second we compared embolism curves according to air flow or hydraulic measurements in 15 vessel and tracheidbearing species to test the hypothesis that the air flow is related to embolism air flow came almost exclusively from air inside the branch during the 25min measurements and was strongly related to embolism we propose a new embolism measurement method that is simple effective rapid and inexpensive and that allows several measurements on the same branch thus opening up new possibilities for studying plant hydraulics
angiosperms and gymnosperms are two major groups of extant seed plants it has been suggested that gymnosperms lack flowering locus t ft a key integrator at the core of flowering pathways in angiosperms taking advantage of newly released gymnosperm genomes we revisited the evolutionary history of the plant phosphatidylethanolaminebinding protein pebp gene family through phylogenetic reconstruction expression patterns in three gymnosperm taxa and heterologous expression in arabidopsis were studied to investigate the functions of gymnosperm ftlike and terminal flower 1 tfl1 like genes phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that an ancient gene duplication predating the divergence of seed plants gave rise to the ft and tfl1 genes expression patterns indicate that gymnosperm tfl1like genes play a role in the reproductive development process while gymft1 and gymft2 the ftlike genes resulting from a duplication event in the common ancestor of gymnosperms function in both growth rhythm and sexual development pathways when expressed in arabidopsis both spruce ftlike and tfl1like genes repressed flowering our study demonstrates that gymnosperms do have ftlike and tfl1like genes frequent gene and genome duplications contributed significantly to the expansion of the plant pebp gene family the expression patterns of gymnosperm pebp genes provide novel insight into the functional evolution of this gene family
in cad computer aided design environments a surface is commonly modeled as a collection of connected regions represented by parametric mappings for meshing such a composite surface a parallelized indirect approach with dynamic load balancing can be used on a shared memory system however this methodology can be inefficient in practice because most existing cad systems use memory caches that are only appropriate to a sequential process two solutions are proposed referred to as the pirate approach and the discrete approach in the first approach the pirate library can be efficiently called in parallel since no caching is used for the storage or evaluation of geometric primitives in the second approach the cad environment is replaced by internal procedures interpolating a discrete geometric support in both cases performance measurements are presented and show an almost linear scaling c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

problems of high turbidity sedimentation water pollution and siltation occur at limboto lake gorontalo indonesia the objective of this study was to analyze the rainfalldischarge relationship and its implications for water quality conditions secchi disk water transparency chlorophylla chla and total organic matter tom were measured in may 2012 september 2012 and march 2013 at three sites of the lake l1 l2 and l3 to observe the impacts on the surrounding catchment based on representative stations for rainfall data from 2004 to 2013 monthly averages of rainfall in marchmay 1667 mm and september 764 mm were used to represent the wet and dry period respectively moreover sediment traps at these three sites were installed in september 2012 based on the analysis it is suggested that rainfall magnitude and land use change at the alopohu river catchment influenced the amount of materials flowing into the lake degrading the water quality specifically the higher average rainfall in may 1845 mm gave a higher average total sediment load 441 g/l/day in addition water transparency decreased with increasing chla this indicates that the concentrations of sediment and nutrients reflected by the high amount of chla influenced the water quality conditions
yellowwood cladrastis kentukea grows in small widely scattered populations in the wild but is also a popular ornamental tree that thrives when planted in urban areas outside its natural range since the small native populations of yellowwood in several states are considered at risk of extirpation the cultivated population could serve as an ex situ repository of yellowwood genetic diversity that could be used to restore lost local populations of the species the potential value of cultivated yellowwood for conservation depends on the genetic diversity among cultivated trees compared to natural populations using nuclear microsatellite markers we genotyped 180 yellowwoods from natural populations in indiana missouri arkansas and kentucky along with 61 trees from urban parks and landscapes in indiana ohio and missouri we found that even when statistics were adjusted based on population size the urban population had higher genetic diversity than any of the wild populations sampled indicating that commerciallygrown yellowwood is most likely a mixture of genotypes from isolated wild populations we observed strong genetic differentiation among wild populations and evidence for inbreeding in at least one of the wild populations

when imitating novel actions typically developing preschoolers often copy components of the demonstration that are unrelated to the modeled action's goal a phenomenon known as 'overimitation' according to the social motivation account overimitation fulfills social affiliation motives ie the imitator's drive to experience social connectedness with the demonstrator and the social context conversely according to the socialcognitive account overimitation reflects overattribution of causal relevance ie the imitator's failure to appreciate that some components of the demonstration are not relevant to the action's outcome autism spectrum disorder asd and william syndrome ws are characterized by reduced and enhanced spontaneous social motivation respectively as well as similar impairments in socialcognition thus providing helpful test cases to understand the nature of overimitation using a novel eyetracking paradigm we examined overimitation in 31 preschoolers with asd 18 ageand iqmatched peers with ws and 19 agematched typically developing children we found that children with ws and typically developing children were more likely to overimitate and to increase their attention to the model's face during demonstration of causally irrelevant actions compared to those with asd these findings will be discussed in the context of support for the socialmotivational account of overimitation c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved

we describe a model for understanding interpersonal attraction in which attraction can be understood as a product of the initial evaluations we make about others the model posits that targets are evaluated on two basic dimensions capacity and willingness such that affective and behavioral attraction result from evaluations of a a target's capacity to facilitate the perceiver's goals/needs and b a target's potential willingness to facilitate those goals/needs the plausibility of the twodimensional model of attraction is evaluated visavis the extant literature on various attraction phenomena including the reciprocity of liking effect pratfall effect matching hypothesis arousal effects and similarity effect we conclude that considerable evidence across a wide range of phenomena supports the idea that interpersonal attraction is principally determined by inferences about the target's capacity and willingness

a compelling innovative approach to teaching gross anatomy is the use of computeraided holographic models they allow for clean timesaving dissection manipulation of structures and appreciation of anatomical relationships and potential elimination of the need for cadavers the present study tests the hypothesis that using holographic models improves mastery of anatomical information firstyear medical students were taught gross anatomy using the dissection of donor cadavers manipulation of digitized 3dimensional holographic renderings and examination of plastinated specimens the effectiveness of these approaches was assessed by comparing students' performance on identification questions on cadavers qc holographic models qh and plastinated specimens qp students in the top quintile of the class performed strongly on qc qh and qp in contrast performance by students in the bottom quintile was uneven; they scored best on qh performance on the qp was relatively nondiscriminating students in the top quintile scored higher on the biological sciences section of the medical college admission test mcat than students in the lowest quintile whereas students in the lowest quintile had higher scores on the verbal section of their mcats the availability of different approaches for presenting gross anatomy improves the success of students in mastering the material particularly for students struggling with the information the use of holographic models apparently reaches students who may be challenged to learn the material using traditional approaches this may be linked to potentially predictive information gleaned through performance on the mcat clin anat 29:917924 2016 c 2016 wiley periodicals inc
developed more than a century ago steinmetz's symbolic method is still puzzling us it puzzles us because in spite of its theoretical inconsistencies it is heuristically efficient however it remains the dominant method in design analysis and operation of electrical power networks the paper shows that steinmetz's mathematical expression for electrical power is based on assumptions inconsistent with the algebra of complex numbers the paper argues that although the numbers are correct the mathematical interpretation of these numbers is not steinmetz got empirical right results for wrong conceptual reasons; the success of the symbolic method is based on the fact that unwittingly steinmetz rediscovered grassmannclifford geometric algebra the paper challenges the dominant paradigm in power theory which represents voltage current active reactive and apparent power as complex numbers and/or vectors phasors the author proposes a new paradigm in which these entities are represented as an algebraic group; the group is composed of a scalar two vectors and a bivector which are residing in a fourdimensional algebraic space and in a twodimensional euclidean geometric space the paper claims that steinmetz's symbolic method is the oldest engineering application of clifford algebra the paper provides a strong motivation for a new didactic of power theory based on geometric algebra as physics' unifying language

evolutionary biology is undergirded by an extensive and impressive set of mathematical models yet only one result fisher's theorem about selection and fitness is generally accorded the status of a fundamental theorem i argue that although its fundamental status is justified by its simplicity and scope there are additional results that seem similarly fundamental i suggest that the most fundamental theorem of evolution is the price equation both because of its simplicity and broad scope and because it can be used to derive four other familiar results that are similarly fundamental: fisher's averageexcess equation robertson's secondary theorem of natural selection the breeder's equation and fisher's fundamental theorem these derivations clarify both the relationships behind these results and their assumptions slightly less fundamental results include those for multivariate evolution and social selection a key feature of fundamental theorems is that they have great simplicity and scope which are often achieved by sacrificing perfect accuracy quantitative genetics has been more productive of fundamental theorems than population genetics probably because its empirical focus on unknown genotypes freed it from the tyranny of detail and allowed it to focus on general issues
we studied three hybrid poplar plantations in quebec canada established on sites with varying soil and environmental characteristics to investigate the effects of logging residues on the water potential carbon isotope ratio and foliar nutrients of planted trees on each site four treatments representing different residue loads as well as treatments aimed at manipulating specific factors of the environment herbicide geotextile were applied to test their effects on seedling water potential carbon isotope ratio and foliar nutrients along with analyses of variance we used structural equation modelling to infer causal relationships of logging residues on height basal diameter and foliar nutrition of trees through their effects on soil temperature soil water content and competing vegetation cover logging residues decreased soil temperature at all sites and woody plants cover at one site out of three height basal diameter and unit leaf mass were strongly related to each other foliar delta c13 n concentration and unit leaf mass increased with decreasing cover of woody plants suggesting an important role of competition for resources overall logging residues had no direct influence on hybrid poplar dimensions after two growing seasons: their effects on the microenvironment of this resource demanding tree species were either cancelling out each other or were not significant enough to have a significant impact on the growth drivers measured for example presence of logging residues might reduce soil temperature impeding overall seedling performance our study highlights the fact that any given silvicultural method aimed at manipulating logging residues has a complex influence involving the interaction of multiple environmental drivers and that the net effect on tree productivity will depend on species and site specific conditions
we present a new mathematical theory explaining the fluid mechanics of subsonic flight which is fundamentally different from the existing boundary layercirculation theory by prandtlkuttazhukovsky formed 100 year ago the new theory is based on our new resolution of d'alembert's paradox showing that slightly viscous bluff body flow can be viewed as zerodrag/lift potential flow modified by 3d rotational slip separation arising from a specific separation instability of potential flow into turbulent flow with nonzero drag/lift for a wing this separation mechanism maintains the large lift of potential flow generated at the leading edge at the price of small drag resulting in a lift to drag quotient of size 1520 for a small propeller plane at cruising speed with reynolds number re approximate to 10 7 and a jumbojet at takeoff and landing with re approximate to 10 8 which allows flight at affordable power the new mathematical theory is supported by computed turbulent solutions of the navierstokes equations with a slip boundary condition as a model of observed small skin friction of a turbulent boundary layer always arising for re >10 6 in close accordance with experimental observations over the entire range of angle of attacks including stall using a few millions of mesh points for a full wingbody configuration
advancements in information communication and sensor technologies have led to new opportunities in medical care and education patients in general prefer visiting the nearest clinic attempt to avoid waiting for treatment and have unequal preferences for different clinics and doctors therefore to enable patients to compare multiple clinics this study proposes a ubiquitous multicriteria clinic recommendation system in this system patients can send requests through their cell phones to the system server to obtain a clinic recommendation once the patient sends this information to the system the system server first estimates the patient's speed according to the detection results of a global positioning system it then applies a fuzzy integer nonlinear programmingordered weighted average approach to assess four criteria and finally recommends a clinic with maximal utility to the patient the proposed methodology was tested in a field experiment and the experimental results showed that it is advantageous over two existing methods in elevating the utilities of recommendations in addition such an advantage was shown to be statistically significant

classic evolutionary and social exchange perspectives suggest that some people have more mate value than others because they possess desirable traits eg attractiveness status that are intrinsic to the individual this article broadens mate value in 2 ways to incorporate relational perspectives first close relationships research suggests an alternative measure of mate value: whether someone can provide a high quality relationship second person perception research suggests that both traitbased and relationship quality measures of mate value should contain a mixture of target variance ie consensus about targets the classic conceptualization and relationship variance ie unique ratings of targets in study 1 participants described their personal conceptions of mate value and revealed themes consistent with classic and relational approaches study 2 used a social relations model blocked design to assess target and relationship variances in participants' romantic evaluations of oppositesex classmates at the beginning and end of the semester in study 3 a onewithmany design documented target and relationship variances among longterm oppositesex acquaintances results generally revealed more relationship variance than target variance; participants' romantic evaluations were more likely to be unique to a particular person rather than consensual furthermore the relative dominance of relationship to target variance was stronger for relational measures of mate value ie relationship quality projections than classic traitbased measures ie attractiveness resources finally consensus decreased as participants got to know one another better and longterm acquaintances in study 3 revealed enormous amounts of relationship variance implications for the evolutionary close relationships and personperception literatures are discussed
suspensions of microswimmers are arich source of fascinating new fluid mechanics recently we predicted the active pipe flow dispersion of gyrotactic microalgae whose orientation is biased by gravity and flow shear analytical theory predicts that these active swimmers disperse in a markedly distinct manner from passive tracers taylor dispersion dispersing swimmers display nonzero drift and effective diffusivity that is nonmonotonic with peclet number such predictions agree with numerical simulations but hitherto have not been tested experimentally here to facilitate comparison we obtain new solutions of the axial dispersion theory accounting both for swimmer negative buoyancy and a local nonlinear response of swimmers to shear provided by two alternative microscopic stochastic descriptions we obtain new predictions for suspensions of the model swimming alga durialiella valina whose motility and buoyant mass we parametrise using tracking video microscopy we then present a new experimental method to measure gyrotactic dispersion using fluorescently stained d satina and provide a preliminary comparison with predictions of a nonzero drift above the mean flow for each microscopic stochastic description finally we propose further experiments for a full experimental characterisation of gyrotactic dispersion measures and discuss the implications of our results for algal dispersion in industrial photobioreactors

background: cocaine addiction is characterized by patterns of compulsive drugtaking including preoccupation with obtaining cocaine and loss of control over drug intake the lateral hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin hcrt system has been implicated in drugtaking and the reinstatement of drugseeking evidence suggests that hcrt may drive drugseeking through activation of specific brain regions implicated in stress system dysfunction including the central amygdala cea the role of hcrt in the persistence of compulsivelike cocainetaking has yet to be fully elucidated methods: systemic and intracea microinfusions of the hcrtreceptor 1 antagonist sb334867 were administered to rats allowed either short 1 hour; sha or long 6 hours; lga access to cocaine selfadministration animals were tested for fixed and progressive ratio responding for cocaine and stressinduced reinstatement of drugseeking in addition using electrophysiological techniques on in vitro slices we investigated gammaaminobutyric acidergic gabaergic neurotransmission in the medial cea and the sensitivity of gabaergic synapses to modulation of the hcrt system in sha or lga rats results: we found systemic administration of sb334867 0 75 15 30 mg/kg dose dependently decreased cocaine intake specifically in lga rats but not in sha rats microinjections of sb334867 20 nmol bilaterally into the cea significantly reduced cocaine intake in lga rats we also observed a significant attenuation of yohimbineinduced reinstatement of cocaineseeking after intracea sb334867 10 nmol administration finally electrophysiological data indicated enhanced gabaergic neurotransmission within the medial cea in lga rats which was blocked with sb334867 10 mu mol/l conclusions: these findings suggest that hcrt neurotransmission within the cea is implicated in compulsivelike cocaineseeking
this paper presents a method for detecting anomalous power consumption patterns attacks using a discrete wavelet transform as well as the variance fractal dimension vfd and an artificial neural network ann for a smart grid the main procedure of the proposed algorithm consists of the following steps: i finding normal and anomalous patterns of power consumption to train the proposed method ii applying wavelet transform to power consumption patterns to extract features iii applying the vfd to the extracted features from step 3 as an input iv training an ann with the extracted features from step 3 and v launching the trained ann from step 4 to detect the anomalous power consumption attack based on a threshold the proposed method can detect an anomalous power consumption attack with 51% accuracy in the worst case scenario
it is hard to estimate optical flow given a realworld video sequence with camera shake and other motion blur in this paper we first investigate the blur parameterisation for video footage using near linear motion elements we then combine a commercial 3d pose sensor with an rgb camera in order to film video footage of interest together with the camera motion we illustrate that this additional camera motion/trajectory channel can be embedded into a hybrid framework by interleaving an iterative blind deconvolution and warping based optical flow scheme our method yields improved accuracy within three other stateoftheart baselines given our proposed ground truth blurry sequences; and several other realworld sequences filmed by our imaging system
in this paper a segmentationbased approach to fine registration of multispectral and multitemporal very high resolution vhr images is proposed the proposed approach aims at estimating and correcting the residual local misalignment also referred to as registration noise rn that often affects multitemporal vhr images even after standard registration the method extracts automatically a set of object representative points associated with regions with homogeneous spectral properties ie objects in the scene such points result to be distributed all over the considered scene and account for the high spatial correlation of pixels in vhr images then it estimates the amount and direction of residual local misalignment for each object representative point by exploiting residual local misalignment properties in a multiple displacement analysis framework to this end a multiscale differential analysis of the multispectral difference image is employed for modeling the statistical distribution of pixels affected by residual misalignment ie rn pixels and detect them the rn is used to perform a segmentationbased fine registration based on both temporal and spatial correlation accordingly the method is particularly suitable to be used for images with a large number of border regions like vhr images of urban scenes experimental results obtained on both simulated and real multitemporal vhr images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method
in this article we investigate if the swedish consumer prices for electricity are adjusted equally fast regardless of whether the nordpool power market prices are decreased or increased due to relatively moderate variations in the variables we have applied quantile regression since it is mainly the large changes above the median that essentially tend to have a considerable effect on the consumer prices moreover in order to adjust for stochastic and deterministic trends autocorrelation structural breaks as well as to measure apt effects in the short and in the mediumrun we apply a wavelet decomposition approach our results show evidence that significantly positive asymmetric price transmission apt effects exist in this market more specifically in the shortrun based on the wavelet decomposition d1 for 12 months cycles we find that that there is a higher propensity to rapidly and systematically increase the consumer prices subsequently to an increase in the nordpool market price compared with the propensity to decrease their customers prices subsequently to a corresponding drop in the nordpool market prices however no significant apt effects were detected in the medium or in the longrun ie the asymmetric price transmission effects are observed only in the shortrun in summary we could isolate significant apt effects in the shortrun 12 months decomposition cycles and for large changes in the dependent variable percentiles 09 therefore only large changes in the nordpool prices lead to feedback effects in the form of asymmetric price transmission effects our evidence supports the notion of firms' downward stickiness of retail prices for maximizing profit which are not expected to be found on a fully efficient market although our finding shows that the price inefficiency is shortlived these large temporal inefficiencies are still costly for the consumers it should be noted that blunt traditional powerless methods do not detect these apt effects while our wavelet quantile methods are powerful and make a significant contribution in the literature by providing new empirical evidence
past research has demonstrated that perceivers are more likely to draw spontaneous trait inferences stis from stereotypeconsistent behaviors than from stereotypeinconsistent behaviors four studies were conducted to examine the moderating role of power in stereotype effects on stis priming power using the scrambled sentence task study 1 found that highpower participants drew stis from elderly stereotypeconsistent but not from elderly stereotypeinconsistent sentences while lowpower participants did not draw stis from elderly stereotypeconsistent or stereotypeinconsistent behaviors study 2 replicated the findings of study 1 by exploring the moderating role of power in gender stereotype effects on stis measuring participants' dispositional power via the personal sense of power study 3 found that dispositional power also moderated the effects of gender stereotype on stis study 4 found that compared with the baseline condition nopower manipulation the lowpower condition inhibited stis from stereotypeconsistent behaviors but the highpower condition did not facilitate sti formation from stereotypeconsistent behaviors the current study is the first to show that power influences the reliance on stereotypes when spontaneously inferring traits from behaviors
backgrounda functional polymorphism within the opioid receptor oprm1 gene rs1799971 a118g previously has been associated with measures of alcohol use and sensitivity to its effects but findings have been inconclusive a recent study suggested that a second nearby variant within oprm1 rs3778150 is robustly associated with heroin dependence and fully explained a smaller observed association with rs1799971 given evidence that the rs3778150c allele is associated with decreased oprm1 expression levels in the human brain the current study sought to test the hypothesis that rs3778150 represents a causal variant within oprm1 that increases risk for a variety of alcohol use phenotypes methodsparticipants with genotype and phenotype data from a larger experimental study n152 were assessed on measures of subjective response to alcohol and alcohol use measures included i the selfrating of the effects of alcohol and the alcohol sensitivity questionnaire ii the biphasic alcohol effects scale baes and ratings of subjective intoxication and iii average number of drinks per week in the past month resultscompared to rs3778150t homozygous individuals carriers of the rs3778150c allele exhibited significantly lower retrospective selfreport levels of alcohol sensitivity carriers of the rs3778150c allele also exhibited lower levels of baes alcoholrelated stimulation during an alcohol challenge and reported higher levels of drinking in the last 30days with the exception of lower levels of baes alcoholrelated sedation the rs1799971 variant did not show consistent significant association with any of the alcohol phenotypes in the presence of rs3778150 conclusionsresults suggest that rs3778150 may be causally related to alcohol use phenotypes and could potentially account for previously observed associations of rs1799971 with substance use phenotypes future studies may investigate potential causal relations among genetic variants in oprm1 subjective response to alcohol and drinking phenotypes to further delineate the effects of rs3778150

lateral flow tests lfts are wellsuited for rapid pointofcare testing in low resource settings the wicking action of the paper strip moves the sample and reagents through the device without a need for pumps but lfts are typically limited to tests that can be carried out in a single fluidic step the materials from lfts can be reconfigured to create paper networks that automatically carry out multistep fluidic operations while retaining the same easytouse format as a conventional lft here we describe basic principles of wicking and systemlevel behavior of paper networks by analogy to electrical circuits we describe key design principles for a previouslydeveloped 2d paper network 2dpn and introduce an alternative linear paper network pseudo1dpn that takes advantage of systemlevel behavior to perform clean sequential fluid delivery while reducing device running time

background and objective: the preoperative planning of bone fractures using information from ct scans increases the probability of obtaining satisfactory results since specialists are provided with additional information before surgery the reduction of complex bone fractures requires solving a 3d puzzle in order to place each fragment into its correct position computerassisted solutions may aid in this process by identifying the number of fragments and their location by calculating the fracture zones or even by computing the correct position of each fragment the main goal of this paper is the development of an automatic method to calculate contact zones between fragments and thus to ease the computation of bone fracture reduction methods: in this paper an automatic method to calculate the contact zone between two bone fragments is presented in a previous step bone fragments are segmented and labelled from ct images and a point cloud is generated for each bone fragment the calculated contact zones enable the automatic reduction of complex fractures to that end an automatic method to match bone fragments in complex fractures is also presented results: the proposed method has been successfully applied in the calculation of the contact zone of 4 different bones from the ankle area the calculated fracture zones enabled the reduction of all the tested cases using the presented matching algorithm the performed tests show that the reduction of these fractures using the proposed methods leaded to a small overlapping between fragments conclusions: the presented method makes the application of puzzlesolving strategies easier since it does not obtain the entire fracture zone but the contact area between each pair of fragments therefore it is not necessary to find correspondences between fracture zones and fragments may be aligned two by two the developed algorithms have been successfully applied in different fracture cases in the ankle area the small overlapping error obtained in the performed tests demonstrates the absence of visual overlapping in the figures c 2016 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved

the sociological interpretation of reality and the processes occurring in it is determined by various approaches to understanding its nature the diversity of these approaches is eventually reduced to its definition as a reality of the social world which reflects on the one hand objectively existing phenomena and processes and on the other hand people's subjective perceptions about the objective reality social actuality as objective social reality exists beyond the subject of social cognition ie objectively each new generation inherits from their parent generations a complex system of economic social and political structures institutions organizations and t5he established relationships which form the social infrastructure of objective reality social reality but people perceive directly only the part of objective reality in which they have their own knowledge due to knowledge of its particular sphere or different objects of reality people get its more or less adequate subjective perception therefore the study of social reality focuses on the process of formation of subjective ideas about the objects of social actuality and attitudes to it which is included in the subject area of sociology of knowledge that is from the standpoint of sociology of knowledge the research object is not reality but ideas about the reality based on subjective perceptions of reality people construct their own reality these perceptions change under the influence of various factors affecting the changes in social reality in the process of its formation a significant change factor is the crisis which affects all spheres of the russian society the article analyzes the impact of the crisis on the changes in social reality in different population groups in russia and the way it is reflected on people's attitudes to each other to family work and education based on analysis of data from nationwide studies it has been revealed that there is a contradiction between russians' traditional attitudes to each other family work and education and the emerging modern attitudes amid crisis this contradiction tends to exacerbate due to the impossibility of maintaining the traditional principles underlying the old way of life which leads to uncertainty and formation of new forms of certainty through the change in life paradigm

geomembrane tubes are sometimes stacked in layers to form higher floodcontrol dykes or other types of geotechnical structures in this study an analytical solution for twolayer stacked geomembrane tubes is proposed and evaluated using largescale laboratory model tests the geometries of the three geomembrane tube models are 10 15 or 20 m in width and 20 30 or 40 m in length respectively the crosssections of the twolayer geomembrane tubes obtained from the analytical solutions agree well with those obtained from model tests the tensile forces measured from the model tests are scattered but show a trend similar to that indicated by the analytical solutions parametric studies are also carried out to investigate the major factors that influence the design of geomembrane tubes several charts are also produced for the design of twolayer impermeable geomembrane tubes resting on a rigid foundation
software fault tolerance is an important issue when using software systems in safetycritical applications in such systems software robustness is an essential requirement for improving software fault tolerance since an operating system os is a major part of a safetycritical system its robustness has considerable influence on the system's overall robustness in recent years researchers have emphasized the importance of considering the os state in robustness testing os state is determined by analysis of the interactions between os components in this paper an approach named timeout is proposed for robustness testing of embedded realtime oss this approach reveals the impact of time delays ie inputs with invalid timing delay on the os kernel functionality timeout takes the os state into account and improves the existing robustness testing methods the proposed approach has been implemented and the experiments have been performed on linux preemptrt which is an embedded realtime implementation of linux operating system the results show that os state can influence the os behavior with respect to fault tolerance in the presence of time delays based on the results of this approach system developers can identify criticality of os states and improve robustness of os in those states
product lifecycle management plm systems provide a useful function with regard to creating and managing product data but because current plm systems are based on individual functions and because of distributed information management it takes a lot of time and effort to collect data as well as analyse engineering planning data therefore it is difficult to achieve an integrated engineering environment and share information across departments or enterprises in the environment of current plm systems moreover current plm systems have concentrated on design and engineering ie design production and the management of design data manufacturing engineering such as layout design is not a focal point in current plm systems hence to achieve an integrated and concurrent engineering environment the authors propose a new concept the digital factory wizard dfw in a plm environment the dfw provides interoperability across heterogeneous systems and integrated information management as well as facilitates information utilisation based on the concept proposed in this research the dfw is composed of four modules: integrated standard schema iss plm integrator layout builder lb and simulation builder sb the iss defines a common data type and structure for supporting interoperability for supporting automatic information exchange through the iss the plm integrator has been developed the third module is lb it helps to generate a factory layout using managed information in plm systems finally the function of sb is the automatic generation of a simulation model the final part of the article suggests implementations and presents a case study to show that the implementation of an effective reliable and interoperable engineering environment is possible and can be performed in a concurrent and integrated manner

structural systems are subject to uncertainties due to variability in many hardtocontrol noise factors which include external loads material properties and construction workmanship traditional structural design methodologies although clearly recognizing the presence of uncertainty omit robustness against the effects of uncertainty in the design process first if the actual uncertainties in the design process are underestimated the design may fail to satisfy safety requirements second to guarantee safety in the presence of high variability of the system response the structural designer may be forced to choose an overly conservative thus inefficient and costly design when robustness against uncertainty is not treated as one of the design objectives the tradeoff between overdesign for safety and underdesign for costsavings is exacerbated this manuscript demonstrates that safe and costeffective structural engineering designs maybe achieved by implementing robust design concepts originally developed in manufacturing engineering to consider robustness against uncertainty this manuscript presents an optimizationbased methodology for the application of robust design principles to structural design and demonstrates its application on an academic problem involving design of a reinforcedconcrete frame c 2013 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

the bacterial ribosome has many functional ribosomal rna rrna sites we have computationally analyzed the rrna regions involved in the interactions between the 30s and 50s subunits various properties of rrna such as solvent accessibility opening energy hydrogen bonding pattern van der waals energy thermodynamic stability were determined based on these properties we selected rrna targets for hybridization with complementary 2 'omethyl oligoribonucleotides 2 'ome rnas further the inhibition efficiencies of the designed ribosomeinterfering 20ome rnas were tested using a betagalactosidase assay in a translation system based on the e coli extract several of the oligonucleotides displayed ic50 values below 1 mu m which were in a similar range as those determined for known ribosome inhibitors tetracycline and pactamycin the calculated opening and van der waals stacking energies of the rrna targets correlated best with the inhibitory efficiencies of 2 'ome rnas moreover the binding affinities of several oligonucleotides to both 70s ribosomes and isolated 30s and 50s subunits were measured using a doublefilter retention assay further we applied heatshock chemical transformation to introduce 2 'ome rnas to e coli cells and verify inhibition of bacterial growth we observed high correlation between ic50 in the cellfree extract and bacterial growth inhibition overall the results suggest that the computational analysis of potential rrna targets within the conformationally dynamic regions of intersubunit bridges can help design efficient antisense oligomers to probe the ribosome function

introduction: distress intolerance has been implicated in various aspects of smoking maintenance and quit behavior although past work has been conducted almost exclusively among european american samples method: the present study sought to extend past work by exploring distinct subdimensions of distress tolerance tolerance appraisal regulation and absorption among a sample of 113 531% female; mag 2281 sd 213 adult daily smokers from mexico city mexico in regard to multiple indices of problematic smoking results: results indicated that the appraisal dimension of distress intolerance was associated with smoking more cigarettes per day a greater number of lifetime failed quit attempts and an increased likelihood of early smoking relapse these findings remained significant after controlling for negative affectivity gender alcohol usage as well as the variance accounted for by other distress tolerance dimensions conclusions: such results provide novel preliminary empirical evidence that lesser perceived ability to tolerate distress because it is appraised as 'unacceptable' may be a particularly important element of the construct in terms of better understanding multiple public health relevant indicators of smoking for mexican smokers overall the present findings uniquely contribute to a growing body of research related to distress intolerance and its implications for explicating the nature of the maintenance of smoking behavior among a highly understudied segment of the smoking population mexican smokers c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
introduction: early diagnosis monitoring of disease activity prediction of treatment response and structural outcome remain major challenges in spondyloarthritis spa biomarkers could play a role in addressing these challenges but in spa there is a lack of suitable biomarkersareas covered: as spa is clinically and pathophysiologically closely related to psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease ibd we reviewed in literature the value of serum biomarkers in these conditions with the aim to find potential candidates for assessing spaexpert commentary: candidates of interest were antimicrobial peptides including serum human beta defensin2 hbd2 and lipocalin2 lcn2 and class1 mhc molecule beta2microglobulin since these biomarkers are relevant in psoriasis and/or ibd from a pathophysiological point of view and may play a role in the pathogenesis of spa we recommend further exploration of their value as biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of spa
the water chemistry and economics of a commercialscale inland marine integrated multitrophic aquaculture imta system was investigated the system used a combination of a constructed wetland sand filter followed by a constructed wetland and geotextile bags to treat solids waste this study is a demonstration of a zerodischarge system where commercial nursery production of wetland plants was combined with a marine ras to treat saline solid waste total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations were measured plant and soil samples were analyzed for tn and tp a significant p < 005 difference in the effluent concentrations was not found the variability inherent in a commercialscale system made it difficult to isolate the individual efficiencies of the three treatment systems production of wetland plants was critical for aiding nutrient removal by facilitating aggregation of solids and providing conditions for denitrification on average the nitrate concentration decreased over time due to the denitrification occurring in the plant beds water samples were analyzed for dissolved metals: mn ni se sr cd li hg mo fe b cu pb zn la ca k and mg; mn and fe showed a gradual increase in concentration over time this imta system successfully produced florida pompano and the fish waste and uneaten feed provided enough nutrients to produce multiple cohorts of wetland plants over a twoyear period an economic analysis indicated that after one year of production the system would produce a profit but the production of florida pompano alone would not result in a positive net return the sales of wetland plants were necessary for the system to breakeven and ultimately produce a profit for the production facility in sarasota fl c 2015 elsevier bv all rights reserved
authentication schemes have been widely deployed access control and mobility management in various communication networks especially the schemes that are based on multifactor authentication such as on password and smart card come to be more practical one of the standard authentication schemes that have been widely used for secure communication over the internet is session initiation protocol sip the original authentication scheme proposed for sip was vulnerable to some crucial security weaknesses to overcome the security problems various improved authentication schemes have been developed especially based on elliptic curve cryptography ecc very recently zhang et al proposed an improved authentication scheme for sip based on ecc using smart cards to overcome the security flaws of the related protocols zhang et al claimed that their protocol is secure against all known security attacks however this paper indicates that zhang et al protocol is still insecure against impersonation attack we show that an active attacker can easily masquerade as a legal server to fool users as a remedy we also improve zhang et al protocol by imposing a little extra computation cost copyright c 2014 john wiley & sons ltd
background: this study examined whether acutely amdd and remitted depressed patients rmdd show deficits in the two aspects of social cognition facial emotion recognition fer and reasoning when using ecologically valid material furthermore we examined whether reduced facial mimicry mediates the association between depressive symptoms and fer and whether fer deficits and reasoning deficits are associated method: in 42 amdd 43 rmdd and 39 healthy controls hc fer was assessed using stimuli from the amsterdam dynamic facial expression set reasoning by the movie for the assessment of social cognition furthermore the activity of zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii were recorded results: amdd recognized happy faces less accurately were less confident recognizing happiness and anger and found it more difficult to recognize happiness anger and fear than hc rmdd were less confident recognizing anger and found it more difficult to recognize happiness anger and fear than hc reduced mimicry did not explain fer deficits amdd but not rmdd showed impaired reasoning limitations: the stimulus material was comparably easy to decode therefore it is possible that the fer deficits of amdd and rmdd patients are more pronounced than demonstrated in this study conclusions: amdd show deficits in fer and reasoning whereas rmdd only show mild impairments in the recognition of emotional expressions there must be other processes besides mimicry that serve the accurate recognition of emotional facial expressions
though bubble column reactors are widely used in industry the present design practice is still closer to an art than a desired state of science because of the complexity of its fluid mechanics the empiricism can be reduced by understanding detailed flow pattern turbulence characteristics and turbulent structures and their effects on the performance such as mixing and axial mixing in both the phases and rate of heat and mass transfer for this purpose in the present work cfd simulations have been undertaken by using standard kepsilon rsm and les turbulence models the cylindrical column having a computational height of hd 900 mm with inside diameter of d 150 mm was employed as a bubble column operated at three superficial gas velocities 20 40 and 100 mm/s the instantaneous three dimensional velocity field is obtained by means of two phase eulerianeulerian large eddy simulations les the conservation equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent energy dissipation rate epsilon have been derived from the two fluid governing equations using the reynolds averaging procedure this enabled accurate estimation of convective transport diffusive transport turbulent transport production and dissipation of k and epsilon these estimations have been compared with the modelled terms of the standard kepsilon and reynolds stress models the difference in values gives an idea about the severity of assumptions made in these models an attempt has been made to bring out the implications of simplifying assumptions c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
people use impressions of an evaluative target's selfesteem to infer their possession of socially desirable traits but will people still use this selfesteem proxy when traitrelevant diagnostic information is available? we test this possibility in two experiments: participants learn that a target person has low or high selfesteem and then receive diagnostic information about the target's academic success or failure and positive or negative affectivity study 1 or watch a video of the target's extraverted or introverted behavior study 2 in both experiments participants' impressions of the target's traits accurately tracked diagnostic information but impressions also revealed an independent selfesteem proxy effect evidently the selfesteem proxy is robust and influences person perception even in the presence of vivid individuating information

this study analyzes the economic activitybod biochemical oxygen demand relationships of the socalled 'dirty' and 'clean' water polluting industries during the period of 19952005 the results indicate that the economic activityenvironment tradeoff of 'dirty' and 'clean' industrial sectors has been altered during the period of study on average pollutionintensive 'dirty' industries in the poorer nations were found to benefit in terms of bod emissions from extra exports and openness to trade the opposite was true for 'clean' sectors where increased trade openness seems to have contributed to a wider gap between poorer and richer nations' pollution intensities with openness to trade skewing innovations away from the 'clean' industries industrial sectors in which the poorer countries specialize the classical model of opening the economy and lifting barriers to technology adoption will not be enough to improve the poorer nations' water quality policies that induce innovation by reducing the cost and increasing the return on innovation particularly on r&d activities in which the poorer countries have a comparative advantage will be necessary in order to improve their economic activity environment relationship c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved

the responses of sand columns internally reinforced with horizontal geotextile layers are studied using a numerical method the sand in the column is modeled using a nonassociated plasticity flow rule the numerical results are validated through laboratory triaxial compression tests carried out on sand columns 70 mm in diameter and reinforced with 4 6 and 8 layers of geotextile numerical and experimental results are compared for deviatoric stresses and volumetric strains the numerical analysis also provides an insight into the reinforcement mechanism the factors affecting the reinforced column response and the advantage of horizontal reinforcement are outlined parametric studies on the influences of reinforcement properties reinforcing layer spacing and specimen diameter as to the response of reinforced sand columns are examined the numerical results show reinforcement has a significant influence from the edge toward the center of the column the boundary makes a constant inclination angle with the reinforcement for the reinforced column with low spacing/diameter ratio the stresses in the influenced areas developed from the two consecutive reinforcements overlapping and the effects compounded the lower the spacing/diameter ratio the greater the column reinforcement strength improved an advantage of horizontal reinforcement is reinforcement rupture or soilreinforcement interfacial slippage will not cause dramatic collapse of the entire column c 2013 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
expectations that others will reciprocate to the benefits they received from us play a crucial role for the establishment of stable reciprocal exchange within social relationships in the current study 3 to 5yearold preschool children allocated in a first phase more resources to one recipient than to another recipient subsequently they had the possibility to ask one of them for valuable resources the results of experiment 1 show that preschool children expect others to reciprocate and strategically ask the ones they benefitted more to share with them experiment 2 demonstrates that there was no selective resource request when the recipients were absent during children's resource allocations experiment 3 showed that children focused on the absolute amount of resources given to the recipients but did not monitor their own relative generosity in judging to whom of the recipients they had been nicer this study provides first evidence that preschool children possess reciprocity expectations and point thus to the strategic nature of early social behavior
latino americans are a rapidly growing ethnic group in the united states but studies of glioblastoma in this population are limited we have evaluated characteristics of 21 184 glioblastoma patients from the surveillance epidemiology and end results seer program of the national cancer institute this seer data from 2001 to 2011 draws from 28% of the us population latinos have a lower incidence of gbm and present slightly younger than nonlatino whites cubans present at an older age than other latino subpopulations latinos have a higher incidence of giant cell glioblastoma than nonlatino whites while the incidence of gliosarcoma is similar despite lower rates of radiation therapy and greater rates of subtotal resection than nonlatino whites latinos have better 1 and 5 year survival rates seer does not record chemotherapy data survivals of latino subpopulations are similar with each other age extent of resection and the use of radiation therapy are associated with improved survival but none of these variables are sufficient in a multivariate analysis to explain the improved survival of latinos relative to nonlatino whites as molecular data is not available in seer records we studied the mgmt and idh status of 571 patients from a ucla database mgmt methylation and idh1 mutation rates are not statistically significantly different between nonlatino whites and latinos for ucla patients with available information chemotherapy and radiation rates are similar for nonlatino white and latino patients but the latter have lower rates of gross total resection and present at a younger age

this paper discusses some of the main issues that are generally found in protection systems of lowvoltage electrical installations and presents a methodology that can be used to analyze and upgrade the existing power system protective devices in these lowvoltage distribution systems the upgrades of existing operating systems especially lowvoltage systems always face an economic challenge where the monetary value spent on upgrades has to be justifiable against the benefit derived if understood clearly the benefit of upgrades to existing protective systems is larger than just making these systems safer a gated approach for the upgrade and proper management of such systems can help in planning for future expansions provide reliability of equipment and decrease the overall risk for the operation of any facility
alzheimer's disease ad is the most common cause of dementia and currently there are no effective diseasemodifying treatments available hallmark symptoms of ad include impaired hippocampusdependent episodic memory and disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms the pathways connecting these symptoms are of particular interest because it is well established that sleep and circadian disruption can impair hippocampusdependent learning and memory in rodents these procedures also markedly suppress adult hippocampal neurogenesis a form of brain plasticity that is believed to play an important role in pattern separation and thus episodic memory a causal role for sleep disruptions in ad pathophysiology is suggested by evidence for sleepdependent glymphatic clearance of metabolic waste products from the brain this review explores a complementary hypothesis that sleep and circadian disruptions in ad contribute to cognitive decline by activating neuroendocrine and neuroinflammatory signaling pathways that suppress hippocampal neurogenesis evidence for this hypothesis underscores the promise of sleep circadian rhythms and neurogenesis as therapeutic targets for remediation of memory impairment in ad c 2017 published by elsevier inc
while smiling enhances women's facial attractiveness the findings are inconclusive for men the present study investigated the effect of smiling on male facial attractiveness for short and longterm prospective partners using east asian and european samples in experiment 1 n 218 where female participants rated male facial attractiveness the facilitative effect of smiling was present when judging longterm partners but absent for short term partners this pattern was observed for east asians as well as for europeans experiment 2 n 71 demonstrated that smiling male faces engendered an impression suitable for longterm partnership eg high ratings of trustworthiness while neutral faces produced an impression suitable for short term partnership eg high ratings of masculinity we discuss these results in terms of opposing evolutionary strategies in mate choice: heritable benefit versus paternal investment
sentiment analysis is an active research area in today's era due to the abundance of opinionated data present on online social networks semantic detection is a subcategory of sentiment analysis which deals with the identification of sentiment orientation in any text many sentiment applications rely on lexicons to supply features to a model various machine learning algorithms and sentiment lexicons have been proposed in research in order to improve sentiment categorization supervised machine learning algorithms and domain specific sentiment lexicons generally perform better as compared to the unsupervised or semisupervised domain independent lexicon based approaches the core hindrance in the application of supervised algorithms or domain specific sentiment lexicons is the unavailability of sentiment labeled training datasets for every domain on the other hand the performance of algorithms based on general purpose sentiment lexicons needs improvement this research is focused on building a general purpose sentiment lexicon in a semisupervised manner the proposed lexicon defines word semantics based on expected likelihood estimate smoothed odds ratio that are then incorporated with supervised machine learning based model selection approach a comprehensive performance comparison verifies the superiority of our proposed approach

we examine the transient evolution of a negatively buoyant laminar plume in an emptying filling box containing a uniform porous medium in the long time limit tau >infinity the box is partitioned into two uniform layers of different densities however the approach towards steady state is characterized by a lower contaminated layer that is continuously stratified the presence of this continuous stratification poses nontrivial analytical challenges; we nonetheless demonstrate that it is possible to derive meaningful bounds on the range of possible solutions particularly in the limit of large mu where mu represents the ratio of the draining to filling time scales the validity of our approach is confirmed by drawing comparisons against the free turbulent plume case where unlike with porous media plumes an analytical solution that accounts for the timevariable continuous stratification of the lower layer is available baines & turner j fluid mech vol 37 1969 pp 5180; germeles j fluid mech vol 71 1975 pp 601623 a separate component of our study considers timevariable forcing where the laminar plume source strength changes abruptly with time when the source is turned on and off with a halfperiod delta tau the depth and reduced gravity of the contaminated layer oscillate between two extrema after the first few cycles different behaviour is seen when the source is merely turned up or down for instance a change of the source reduced gravity leads to a permanent change of interface depth which is a qualitative point of difference from the free turbulent plume case
light detection and ranging lidar data classification provides useful thematic maps for numerous geospatial applications several methods and algorithms have been proposed recently for lidar data classification most studies focused on objectbased analysis because of its advantages over perpixelbased methods however several issues such as parameter optimization attribute selection and development of transferable rulesets remain challenging in this topic this study contributes to lidar data classification by developing an approach that integrates ant colony optimization aco and rulebased classification first lidarderived digital elevation and digital surface models were integrated with highresolution orthophotos second the processed raster was segmented with the multiresolution segmentation method subsequently the parameters were optimized with a supervised technique based on fuzzy analysis a total of 20 attributes were selected based on general knowledge on the study area and lidar data; the best subset containing 12 attributes was then selected via aco these attributes were utilized to develop rulesets through the use of a decision tree algorithm and a thematic map was generated for the study area results revealed the robustness of the proposed method which has an overall accuracy of similar to 95% and a kappa coefficient of 094 the rulebased approach with all attributes and the k nearest neighbor knn classification method were applied to validate the results of the proposed method the overall accuracy of the rulebased method with all attributes was similar to 88% kappa 082 whereas the knn method had an overall accuracy of <70% and produced a poor thematic map the selection of the aco algorithm was justified through a comparison with three wellknown feature selection methods on the other hand the transferability of the developed rules was evaluated by using a second lidar dataset at another study area the overall accuracy and the kappa index for the second study area were 92% and 090 respectively overall the findings indicate that the selection of a subset with significant attributes is important for accurate lidar data classification with objectbased methods
we evaluated the accuracy of peer ratings of roommates' personality characteristics against roommate selfratings as a function of rating domain observability instead of the usual ratings of broad personality traits however our domains represented peer ratings of narrow exemplars of personality traits specifically we compared roommate ratings on a observable traitrelated behaviors with b unobservable traitrelated attitudes or beliefs we observed greater selfpeer agreement in rating behaviors in general than in rating beliefs we also observed greater tendency of raters to adopt an assumed similarity heuristic when judging their roommates' attitudes and beliefs than their behaviors we discuss the contribution of these findings to understanding the determinants of accuracy in personality judgments and developing best practices for personality assessment c 2014 elsevier inc all rights reserved
structured traumafocused cognitivebehavioral therapy cbt techniques are widely considered an effective intervention for children who experienced sexual abuse however unstructured ie nondirective play/experiential techniques have a longer history of widespread promotion and are preferred by many practicing clinicians no evidence is available however to determine how the integration of these techniques impacts treatment outcome in this study communitybased clinicians who received training in a structured traumafocused cognitivebehavioral intervention administered pretreatment and posttreatment evaluations to 260 sexually abused children presenting with elevated posttraumatic stress in addition they completed a questionnaire describing the treatment techniques implemented with each child overall significant improvement was observed for each of the six clinical outcomes regression analyses indicated that technique selection was a significant factor in posttreatment outcome for posttraumatic stress dissociation anxiety and anger/aggression in general a greater utilization of the structured cbt techniques was related to lower posttreatment scores whereas a higher frequency of play/experiential techniques was associated with higher posttreatment scores however no interaction effects were observed the implication of these findings for clinical practice and future research are examined
evapotranspiration et is one of the most important components of the hydrological cycle but it is often the most difficult variable to determine at basin scale traditionally et is estimated using pointbased measurements collected at meteorological stations but the nonspatial nature of these measurements often leads to significant errors when utilized at watershed scale in this study the metric mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration approach was evaluated using remotely sensed observations from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensor and data from meteorological stations in the lower catchment of the buyuk menderes basin in western turkey in the form of actual et maps at daily and monthly intervals between 1st april and 30th september 2010 the energy fluxes and daily et maps resulting from metric were compared with et data estimated with the help of meteorological parameters these results were found to be compatible with the groundbased estimations which suggest considerable potential for the metric model for estimating spatially distributed actual et values with little groundbased weather data

computational prediction yields efficient and scalable initial assessments of how variants of unknown significance may affect human health however when discrepancies between these predictions and direct experimental measurements of functional impact arise inaccurate computational predictions are frequently assumed as the source here we present a methodological analysis indicating that shortcomings in both computational and biological data can contribute to these disagreements we demonstrate that incomplete assaying of multifunctional proteins can affect the strength of correlations between prediction and experiments; a variant's full impact on function is better quantified by considering multiple assays that probe an ensemble of protein functions additionally many variants predictions are sensitive to protein alignment construction and can be customized to maximize relevance of predictions to a specific experimental question we conclude that inconsistencies between computation and experiment can often be attributed to the fact that they do not test identical hypotheses aligning the design of the computational input with the design of the experimental output will require cooperation between computational and biological scientists but will also lead to improved estimations of computational prediction accuracy and a better understanding of the genotypephenotype relationship
background: rett syndrome rtt is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused mostly by disruptions in the mecp2 gene mecp2null mice show imbalances in neuronal excitability and synaptic communications several previous studies indicate that augmenting synaptic gaba receptors gaba a rs can alleviate rttlike symptoms in mice in addition to the synaptic gaba a rs there is a group of gaba a rs found outside the synaptic cleft with the capability to produce sustained inhibition which may be potential therapeutic targets for the control of neuronal excitability in rtt methods: wildtype and mecp2null mice were randomly divided into four groups receiving the extrasynaptic gaba a r agonist 4 5 6 7tetrahydroisoxazolo 5 4c pyridin3ol hydrochloride thip and vehicle control respectively lowdose thip was administered to neonatal mice through lactation rttlike symptoms including lifespan breathing motor function and social behaviors were studied when mice became mature changes in neuronal excitability and norepinephrine biosynthesis enzyme expression were studied in electrophysiology and molecular biology results: with no evident sedation and other adverse side effects earlylife exposure to thip extended the lifespan alleviated breathing abnormalities enhanced motor function and improved social behaviors of mecp2null mice such beneficial effects were associated with stabilization of locus coeruleus neuronal excitability and improvement of norepinephrine biosynthesis enzyme expression conclusions: thip treatment in early lives might be a therapeutic approach to rttlike symptoms in mecp2null mice and perhaps in people with rtt as well

in the genii river basin southern spain agriculture is the greatest pressure on freshwater demand furthermore water degradation caused by soil erosion is becoming a key environmental concern this study aims to assess the waterrelated impacts of agriculture combining the use of an ecohydrological model swat with a spatiotemporal water footprint assessment to evaluate the current status of streamflow blue water soil water green water and the assimilability of sediments by streamflow grey water footprint the common agricultural policy cap requires farmers to adopt certain agricultural practices that are beneficial for the environment such practices could affect the conditions of available land and water resources because of the importance of applying the best land management practices for the maintenance of sustainable water resources the study also infers probable water availability and water pollution level changes under different post2013 cap scenarios the genii streamflow is highly regulated and as a result it is hard to discern significant changes p < 005 under the proposed scenarios however there is a shift with afforestation measures from unproductive ie direct soil evaporation to productive water ie evapotranspired water from agricultural and natural areas excluding nongrowing periods consumption the probability of annual evapotranspiration from natural areas being greater in afforestation scenarios than in the baseline scenario is 070 to 088 whereas the likelihood of soil water evaporation being lower is 060 evapotranspiration in natural areas increases by about 521% from september to may under afforestation measures compared with the baseline scenario whereas soil water evaporation decreases by 30% in winter the grey water footprint and water pollution level decrease by 19% and 9% respectively with the highest streamflow conditions under afforestation as opposed to current conditions however water pollution levels of suspended solids greater than 1 indicate that the river flow is not capable of assimilating the existing sediment loads since land use changes and agricultural practices have a major impact on water resources the post2013 cap reform can provide environmental benefits for water allocation and mitigation of water pollution however further efforts are required to better align the policy goals of the cap and the water framework directive c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
in this paper we present an overview of the entropy production in fluid dynamics in a systematic way first of all we clarify a rigorous derivation of the incompressible limit for the navierstokesfourier system of equations based on the asymptotic analysis which is a very well known mathematical technique used to derive macroscopic limits of kinetic equations chapmanenskog expansion and hilbert expansion are popular methodologies this allows to overcome the theoretical limits of assuming that the material derivative of the density simply vanishes moreover we show that the fundamental gibbs relation in classical thermodynamics can be applied to nonequilibrium flows for generalizing the entropy and for expressing the second law of thermodynamics in case of both incompressible and compressible flows this is consistent with the thermodynamics of irreversible processes and it is an essential condition for the design and optimization of fluid flow devices summarizing a theoretical framework valid at different regimes both incompressible and compressible sheds light on entropy production in fluid mechanics with broad implications in applied mechanics
background autism spectrum disorders asd are syndromes that are predominantly defined by behavioral features such as impaired social interactions restricted verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive or stereotyped behavior in the past few decades the reported prevalence of asd has increased dramatically this growth can be partially explained by an increased level of awareness of the problem among professionals and better diagnostic methods nevertheless underpinning causes of asd have not yet been detailed and explained it is suggested that rather than having a single causative factor asd pathogenesis is influenced by environmental or genetic factors or a combination of both the aims of this review are to describe the environmental risk factors associated with asd so as to provide a reference basis for current and future clinical and experimental work materials and methods on the basis of a pubmed search we review the existing knowledge on environmental factors associated with asd results a series of environmental factors have been repeatedly reported as risk factors for asd in existing studies conclusion air pollution organic toxicants seasonal factors psychological stress migration birth order and nutrition may have a close relationship with the incidence of asd
background: our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying alzheimer's disease ad remains incomplete previous studies have revealed that genetic factors provide a significant contribution to the pathogenesis and development of ad in the past years numerous genes implicated in this disease have been identified via genetic association studies on candidate genes or at the genomewide level however in many cases the roles of these genes and their interactions in ad are still unclear a comprehensive and systematic analysis focusing on the biological function and interactions of these genes in the context of ad will therefore provide valuable insights to understand the molecular features of the disease method: in this study we collected genes potentially associated with ad by screening publications on genetic association studies deposited in pubmed the major biological themes linked with these genes were then revealed by function and biochemical pathway enrichment analysis and the relation between the pathways was explored by pathway crosstalk analysis furthermore the network features of these adrelated genes were analyzed in the context of human interactome and an adspecific network was inferred using the steiner minimal tree algorithm results: we compiled 430 human genes reported to be associated with ad from 823 publications biological theme analysis indicated that the biological processes and biochemical pathways related to neurodevelopment metabolism cell growth and/or survival and immunology were enriched in these genes pathway crosstalk analysis then revealed that the significantly enriched pathways could be grouped into three interlinked modulesneuronal and metabolic module cell growth/survival and neuroendocrine pathway module and immune responserelated moduleindicating an adspecific immuneendocrineneuronal regulatory network furthermore an adspecific protein network was inferred and novel genes potentially associated with ad were identified conclusion: by means of network and pathwaybased methodology we explored the pathogenetic mechanism underlying ad at a systems biology level results from our work could provide valuable clues for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying ad in addition the framework proposed in this study could be used to investigate the pathological molecular network and genes relevant to other complex diseases or phenotypes
we here explore for the very first time how an advanced multiscale mathematical modeling approach may support the design of a provenly successful tissue engineering concept for mandibular bone the latter employs doubleporous potentially cracked single millimetersized granules packed into an overall conglomeratetype scaffold material which is then gradually penetrated and partially replaced by newly grown bone tissue during this process the newly developing scaffoldbone compound needs to attain the stiffness of mandibular bone under normal physiological conditions in this context the question arises how the compound stiffness is driven by the key design parameters of the tissue engineering system: macroporosity crack density as well as scaffold resorption/bone formation rates we here tackle this question by combining the latest stateoftheart mathematical modeling techniques in the field of multiscale micromechanics into an unprecedented suite of highly efficient semianalytically defined computation steps resolving several levels of hierarchical organization from the millimeter down to the nanometerscale this includes several types of homogenization schemes namely such for porous polycrystals with elongated solid elements for cracked matrixinclusion composites as well as for assemblies of coated spherical compounds together with the experimentally known stiffnesses of hydroxyapatite crystals and mandibular bone tissue the new mathematical model suggests that early stiffness recovery ie within several weeks requires total avoidance of microcracks in the hydroxyapatite scaffolds while midterm stiffness recovery ie within several months is additionally promoted by provision of small granule sizes in combination with high bone formation and low scaffold resorption rates
the eastern hognose snake heterodon platirhinos is a species of conservation concern especially in the northeastern portion of its range they remain relatively common at cape cod national seashore barnstable county massachusetts usa where we studied their spatial ecology and habitat selection we radiotracked 17 adult snakes 10 f 7 m from may 2009 to november 2011 yielding 765 relocations we conducted a useavailability analysis to investigate patterns of microhabitat selection using a subset of snake locations we conducted a compositional analysis of habitat selection at multiple spatial scales within home ranges using a highresolution 1m pixel size vegetation cover map of the study area snakes moved frequently and had large home ranges x 354 ha relative to other snake species of similar body size but exhibited variation in home range size among individuals 1 209 ha movements peaked at different times of year for each sex and were most different between sexes in fall in gravid females movement was significantly greater in the 2week postoviposition period versus the 2week preoviposition period estimates of home range and average daily movements x 301 m/day were lower than estimates from other studies of eastern hognose snakes possibly because of a greater density of resources at our study area probability of snake habitat use increased with grass and leaf litter and decreased with open soil compositional analysis revealed a strong avoidance of open dune areas a comparison of edge density between use and random locations within home ranges revealed an apparent preference for edge habitat we recommend that resource managers should limit recreational disturbance to and maintain the patchy mosaic of early successional vegetation with abundant edge to ensure the persistence of appropriate habitat for the species we identified the timing of peak seasonal movements and recommend that this information be used to help prevent road mortality for this important population c 2017 the wildlife society

drosophila ovary is recognized as one of the best model systems to study stem cell biology in vivo we had previously identified an autonomous role of the histone hi in germline stem cell gsc maintenance here we found that histone h1 depletion in escort cells ecs resulted in an increase of spectrosomecontaining cells sccs an ovary tumorlike phenotype further analysis showed that the dpp pathway is excessively activated in these scc cells while the expression of bam is attenuated in the h1depleted ecs both transposon activity and dna damage had increased dramatically followed by ec apoptosis which is consistent with the role of h1 in other somatic cells surprisingly h1depleted ecs acquired cap cell characteristics including dpp expression and the resulting abnormal dpp level inhibits scc further differentiation most interestingly double knockdown of h1 and dpp in ecs can reduce the number of sccs to the normal level indicating that the additional dpp secreted by ecs contributes to the germline tumor taken together our findings indicate that histone h1 is an important epigenetic factor in controlling ec characteristics and a key suppressor of germline tumor
finite element mesh generators exist in the public domain a few even based on a parametric device description the typical mesh generator requires some manmachine interaction to define the points and boundary conditions and does not work for nonstop optimization iterations for which we need a mesh dynamically evolving through the iterations with optimization variables as changing parameters such mesh generators as do exist are rare commercial and not easily available to researchers except at great cost and never with the code to modify them to suit individual needs we take a regular open source mesh generator and write a scriptbased interface as open source to run nonstop for optimization we then use it to create a nondestructive evaluation system for army ground vehicles' defect characterization and use it equally for machine design a simple scheme of averaging neighbour heights gives us a smooth geometry without having to use bezier curves the mesh runs on the central processing unit but finite element optimization is on the graphics processing unit for speed and practicable testing times

the main goal of introducing an identitybased cryptosystem and certificateless cryptosystem was avoiding certificates' management costs in turn the goal of introducing a certificatebased cryptosystem was to solve the certificate revocation problem in this paper we propose a new digital implicit and explicit certificatesbased hess's signature iecbhs scheme that combines the features of a standard public key infrastructure pki and certificatebased cryptosystem our iecbhs scheme is an efficient certificatesbased signature the security analysis proves that the scheme is secure against two game attacks in the random oracle model the security is closely related to the difficulty of solving the computational diffiehellman and discrete logarithm problems the iecbhs scheme when compared with other signature schemes has similar efficiency and is both more flexible and more useful in practice it is possible to revoke the explicit certificate and use that fact during digital signature verification thus our scheme is useful in applications where typical mechanisms of standard pki are used one of many important security features is resistance to denial of signature verification attack also it is impossible for a trusted authority to recreate a partial private key even with cooperation with the signer
computeraided diagnosis cad of alzheimer's disease ad has drawn the attention of computer vision research community over the last few years several attempts have been made to adapt pattern recognition approaches to specific neuroimaging data such as structural mri smri for early ad diagnosis one strategy is to boost the discrimination power of such approaches by integrating complementary imaging modalities in a single learning framework diffusion tensor imaging dti is a new and promising modality giving complementary information to the anatomical mri however including relevant dti information from such modality is a challenging problem in this paper we propose to extract local imagederived biomarkers from dti and smri to construct multimodal ad signatures to assess the relevance of such modalities as well as to optimize the classifier we integrate complementary information using a multiple kernel learning mkl framework for ad subjects recognition to evaluate our method we perform experiments on a subset from the alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative adni dataset both t1weighted mri and mean diffusivity md maps from the dti modality of 45 ad patients 52 normal control nc and 58 mild cognitive impairment mci subjects have been used the obtained results indicate that our multimodal approach yields significant improvement in accuracy over using each single modality independently the classification accuracies obtained by the proposed method are 902% 7942% and 7663% for respectively ad vs nc mci vs nc and ad vs mci binary classification problems for the mci classification problem the proposed fusion framework leads to an average increase about at least 9% for the accuracy 5% for the specificity and 15% for the sensitivity c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
optimal hemodynamics in aortapulmonary shunt reconstruction is essential for improved postoperative recovery of the newborn congenital heart disease patient however prior to in vivo execution the prediction of postoperative hemodynamics is extremely challenging due to the interplay of multiple confounding physiological factors it is hypothesized that the postoperative performance of the surgical shunt can be predicted through computational blood flow simulations that consider patient size shunt configuration cardiac output and the complex threedimensional disease anatomy utilizing only the routine patientspecific presurgery clinical data sets we demonstrated an intelligent decision making process for a real patient having pulmonary artery atresia and ventricular septal defect for this patient a total of 12 customized candidate shunt configurations are contemplated and reconstructed virtually using a sketchbased computeraided anatomical editing tool candidate shunt configurations are evaluated based on the parameters that are computed from the flow simulations which include 3d flow complexity outlet flow splits shunt patency coronary perfusion and energy loss our results showed that the modified blalocktaussig mbt shunt has 12% higher right pulmonary artery rpa and 40% lower left pulmonary artery lpa flow compared to the central shunt configuration also the rpa flow regime is distinct from the lpa creating an uneven flow split at the pulmonary arteries for all three shunt sizes right mbt innominate and central configurations cause higher pulmonary artery pa flow and lower coronary artery pressure than right and left mbt subclavian configurations while there is a tradeoff between energy loss flow split and coronary artery pressure overall the mbt shunts provide sufficient pa perfusion with higher coronary artery pressures and could be preferred for similar patients having pa overflow risk central shunts would be preferred otherwise particularly for cases with very low pa overflow risk c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
in the transition to renewable energy systems fluctuating renewable energy such as wind and solar power plays a large and important role this creates a challenge in terms of meeting demands as the energy production fluctuates based on weather patterns to utilise high amounts of fluctuating renewable energy the energy system has to be more flexible in terms of decoupling demand and production this paper investigates two potential ways to increase flexibility the first is the interconnection between energy systems for instance between two countries labelled as crossborder interconnection and the second is crosssector interconnection ie the integration between different parts of an energy system for instance heat and electricity this paper seeks to compare the types of interconnectivity and discuss to which extent they are mutually beneficial to do this the study investigates two energy systems that represent northern and southern europe both systems go through three developmental steps that increase the crosssector interconnectivity at each developmental step an increasing level of transmission capacities is examined to identify the benefits of crossborder interconnectivity the results show that while both measures increase the system utilisation of renewable energy and the system efficiency the crosssector interconnection gives the best system performance to analyse the possible interaction between crosssector and crossborder interconnectivity two main aspects have to be clarified the first part defines the approach and the second is the construction of the two archetypes c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
monte carlo method can provide high fidelity neutronic analysis of different types of nuclear reactors owing to its advantages of the flexible geometry modeling and the use of continuousenergy nuclear cross sections it can also be coupled with thermalhydraulics codes to consider feedbacks due to the effect of thermal motion of target nucleus known as doppler effect special treatments have to be used for cross sections at different temperature points the traditional approach of pregenerated cross sections has difficulty of memory footprint when the number of temperature points is large the target motion sampling tms method was proposed and developed in serpent code for temperature treatment based on the woodcock tracking in this paper the tms method was developed in rmc code based on the ray tracking moreover dopplerbroadening rejection correction dbrc technique was also implemented in rmc to consider the effect of thermal motion on scattering kinematics the pregenerated technique was proposed and applied to accelerate the calculation of tms method the results show that tms method is equivalent to the exact crosssections with dbrc while tms in rmc has higher efficiency in the cases of pwr and htgr no matter that the number of nuclides is small or large c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
a nonwoven fabric has been widely used in geotextile engineering in recent years; its tensile strength is an important behaviour since the fibre distributions in nonwoven fabrics are random and discontinuous the unitcell model of a nonwoven fabric cannot be developed to simulate its tensile behaviour this article presents our research on using finite element method fem to study the tensile behaviour of a nonwoven fabric in macroscale based on the classical laminate composite theory the laminate orientation was considered with orientation distribution function of fibres which has been obtained by analysing the data acquired from scanning electron microscopy with hough transform the fe model of a nonwoven fabric was developed using abaqus software; the required engineering constants of a nonwoven fabric were obtained from experimental data finally the nonwoven specimens were stretched along with machine direction and cross direction the experimental stressstrain curves were compared with the results of fe simulations the approximate agreement proves the validity of an fe model which could be used to precisely simulate the stress relaxation strain creep bending and shear property of a nonwoven fabric

a recently emerging view in music cognition holds that music is not only social and participatory in its production but also in its perception ie that music is in fact perceived as the sonic trace of social relations between a group of real or virtual agents while this view appears compatible with a number of intriguing music cognitive phenomena such as the links between beat entrainment and prosocial behaviour or between strong musical emotions and empathy direct evidence is lacking that listeners are at all able to use the acoustic features of a musical interaction to infer the affiliatory or controlling nature of an underlying social intention we created a novel experimental situation in which we asked expert music improvisers to communicate 5 types of nonmusical social intentions such as being domineering disdainful or conciliatory to one another solely using musical interaction using a combination of decoding studies computational and psychoacoustical analyses we show that both musicallytrained and non musicallytrained listeners can recognize relational intentions encoded in music and that this social cognitive ability relies to a sizeable extent on the information processing of acoustic cues of temporal and harmonic coordination that are not present in any one of the musicians' channels but emerge from the dynamics of their interaction by manipulating these cues in twochannel audio recordings and testing their impact on the social judgements of nonmusician observers we finally establish a causal relationship between the affiliation dimension of social behaviour and musical harmonic coordination on the one hand and between the control dimension and musical temporal coordination on the other hand these results provide novel mechanistic insights not only into the social cognition of musical interactions but also into that of nonverbal interactions as a whole c 2017 the authors published by elsevier bv

panic patients experience recurrent panic attacks two main neurochemical hypotheses have been proposed to explain this vulnerability the first suggests that panic patients have deficient serotonergic inhibition of neurons localized in the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain that organizes defensive reactions to cope with proximal threats as well as of sympathomotor control areas of the rostral ventrolateral medulla that generate neurovegetative symptoms of the panic attack the second proposes that endogenous opioids buffer panic attacks in normal subjects and their deficit results in heightened sensitivity to suffocation and separation anxiety in panic patients experimental results obtained in rat models of panic indicate that serotonin interacts synergistically with endogenous opioids in the dorsal periaqueductal gray through 5ht1a and muopioid receptors to inhibit proximal defense and supposedly panic attacks these findings allow reconciliation of the serotonergic and opioidergic hypotheses of panic pathophysiology they also indicate that endogenous opioids are likely to participate in the panicolytic action of antidepressants and suggest that exogenous opioids may be useful for treating panic patients resistant to conventional pharmacotherapy c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

aim to investigate whether morphological variation in a continental radiation of lizards chamaeleonidae was driven by ecological opportunity location kwazulunatal south africa methods chameleons from all morphotypes were genotyped n279 using 10 microsatellite and one mitochondrial marker n130 genetic spatial structure was examined in a bayesian framework and compared to ecomorphological forms to identify distinct chameleon groups using a total evidence approach ecological niche modelling projected back to the last glacial maximum and the last interglacial was used to make inferences regarding the processes that may have facilitated diversification through ecological opportunity results for the three inland groups genetic and morphological evidence were in agreement suggesting these are candidate species however there was discordance in evidence for populations from coastal regions although the different timescales of the data allow us to make some inferences regarding this disparity the microsatellite data suggest at least three independent origins of coastal chameleons although all three clusters show the same ecomorph which indicates convergence of phenotype in a similar environment the species distribution models revealed high niche stability among inland groups suggesting the presence of refugia for these chameleons; whereas the coastal niche is more dynamic and likely resulted in recent origins of these groups main conclusions a dynamic climatic niche and corresponding vegetation shifts are likely to have shaped contrasting ecomorphological and genetic patterns within this continental radiation by creating ecological opportunity for the coastal chamleons in contrast inland groups are in climatically stable regions and show concordance between lines of evidence suggesting that niche stability has allowed for these chameleons to diverge genetically and phenotypically

a common approach to model memristive systems is to include empirical window functions to describe edge effects and nonlinearities in the change of the memristance we demonstrate that under quite general conditions each window function can be associated with a sigmoidal curve relating the normalised timedependent memristance to the time integral of the input conversely this explicit relation allows us to derive window functions suitable for the mesoscopic modelling of memristive systems from a variety of wellknown sigmoidals such sigmoidal curves are defined in terms of measured variables and can thus be extracted from input and output signals of a device and then transformed to its corresponding window we also introduce a new generalised window function that allows the flexible modelling of asymmetric edge effects in a simple manner copyright c 2016 john wiley & sons ltd
social pain is often associated with social rejection and shares neural correlates with the bothersome aspect of physical pain which may also indicate an overlap in function pain has been described as a motivational signal to respond to the source of the pain in an adaptive way such as by altering behavior we tested whether social pain causes similarly adaptive alterations in behavior participants played computerized balltossing tasks with putative playersone who passed to and one who excluded the participant from playin both a social and nonsocial version we assessed the behavioral consequences of social pain by comparing the number of throws to each stimulus social rejector vs nonsocial rejector over the course of the task posttask questionnaires assessed subjective feelings of social pain a decrease in throws to the rejecting stimulus was only observed in the social version indicating that rejection that is social in nature leads to change in behavior moreover participants reported more negative feelings toward the rejecting stimulus in the social than in the nonsocial version these subjective feelings of social pain mediated the effect of version of the game social vs nonsocial on changes in behavior indicating that social pain from social rejection causes changes in behavior
mentalizing or theory of mind tom ie the ability to recognize what people think or feel is a crucial component of human social intelligence it has been recently proposed that tom can be decomposed into automatic and controlled neurocognitive components where only the latter engage executive functions eg working memory inhibitory control and task switching critical here is the notion that such dual processes are expected to follow different developmental dynamics in this work we provide novel experimental evidence for this notion we report data gathered from about thirty thousand participants of a massive web poll of peoples cognitive skills which included tom and executive functions we show that although the maturation of executive functions occurs in synchrony around 20 years of age this is not the case for different mentalizing competences which either mature before for elementary tom constituents or after for higherlevel tom in addition we show that interindividual differences in executive functions predict variability in higherlevel tom skills from the onset of adulthood onwards ie after the complete maturation of executive functions taken together these results indicate that the relative contribution of tom's controlled component significantly changes with age in particular this implies that over the lifespan people may rely upon distinct cognitive architectures when reading others' minds c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

the human left inferior parietal lobule lipl plays a pivotal role in many cognitive functions and is an important node in the default mode network dmn although many previous studies have proposed different parcellation schemes for the lipl the detailed functional organization of the lipl and the exact correspondence between the dmn and lipl subregions remain unclear mounting evidence indicates that spontaneous fluctuations in the brain are strongly associated with cognitive performance at the behavioral level however whether a consistent functional topographic organization of the lipl during rest and under task can be revealed remains unknown here they used resting state functional connectivity rsfc and task related coactivation patterns separately to parcellate the lipl and identified seven subregions four subregions were located in the supramarginal gyrus smg and three subregions were located in the angular gyrus ag the subregion specific networks and functional characterization revealed that the four anterior subregions were found to be primarily involved in sensorimotor processing movement imagination and inhibitory control audition perception and speech processing and social cognition whereas the three posterior subregions were mainly involved in episodic memory semantic processing and spatial cognition the results revealed a detailed functional organization of the lipl and suggested that the lipl is a functionally heterogeneous area in addition the present study demonstrated that the functional architecture of the lipl during rest corresponds with that found in task processing c 2017wiley periodicals inc
we present thewizz an open source and userfriendly software for estimating the redshift distributions of photometric galaxies with unknown redshifts by spatially crosscorrelating them against a reference sample with known redshifts the main benefit of thewizz is in separating the angular pair finding and correlation estimation from the computation of the output clustering redshifts allowing anyone to create a clustering redshift for their sample without the intervention of an 'expert' it allows the end user of a given survey to select any subsample of photometric galaxies with unknown redshifts match this sample's catalogue indices into a valueadded data file and produce a clustering redshift estimation for this sample in a fraction of the time it would take to run all the angular correlations needed to produce a clustering redshift we show results with this software using photometric data from the kilodegree survey kids and spectroscopic redshifts from the galaxy and mass assembly survey and the sloan digital sky survey the results we present for kids are consistent with the redshift distributions used in a recent cosmic shear analysis from the survey we also present results using a hybrid machine learningclustering redshift analysis that enables the estimation of clustering redshifts for individual galaxies thewizz can be downloaded at http://githubcom/morriscb/thewizz/

the red foxes vulpes vulpes indigenous to the mountains of the western united states are highelevation specialists that could face range reduction due to climatic warming as well as potential encroachment loss of adaptive alleles and displacement by introduced nonnative red foxes we investigated the genetic integrity of the native rocky mountain red fox v v macroura in colorado through analysis of the composition distribution and patterns of gene flow between native and nonnative red fox populations along an elevational gradient the study area spanned the high plains around denver in the east to the alpine zone of the rocky mountains adjacent to gunnison and crested butte in the west we used microsatellites and mitochondrial dna mtdna from colorado foxes along with previously published reference data from other native western and nonnative populations to evaluate the distribution of native versus nonnative ancestry and its relationship to elevation distance and landscape type nonnative red fox ancestry predominated in denver and lowlying areas whereas native ancestry was most prevalent at high elevations the genetic integrity of foxes at higher elevations ie within the historical native range was greater in terms of mtdna than nuclear dna consistent with higher malemediated gene flow nonnative admixture was most pronounced in humanaltered landscapes our findings provide baseline data necessary to monitor future trends of these rocky mountain red fox populations and highlight the potential for similar threats to affect genetic integrity of endangered montane red fox subspecies along the pacific crest
the last climatic years have recorded a recrudescence of risk phenomena especially floods and droughts because of this reason an acute shortage of water is presently felt even in the mountainous areas hydrological data have been recorded at 5 gauges distributed in the middle and lowers sectors of the basin suha river basin includes a large number of inhabitants attracted here some time ago by mining exploitations the closing of ostra mine has not led to a decrease in population and thus water demands are higher and higher and underground resources are used minimum discharge in the basin is extremely low in comparison to the reality of other mountain catchments at stulpicani gauge a mean minimum discharge of 0611 m 3 /s has been recorded during 19702013 this situation is due first of all to the rapid infiltration of water in the very permeable deposits sands gravels boulders an increase in water demands is probable if the comfort of the dwellings is improved by raising the number of baths and showers of greenhouses for vegetables growing of guesthouses with pools etc in order to preserve water resources in the area is imposed the keeping of the present forested surfaces and the adequate control of tailings dumps so as to avoid underground and surface water pollution due to practices like toilets lacking septic tanks or gathering of manure on unisolated platforms the conservation of present water quality especially the underground one is imperious
the adrenal cortex is critical for physiological function as the central site of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis it possesses a great degree of specialized compartmentalization at multiple hierarchical levels ranging from the tissue down to the molecular levels in this paper we discuss this functionalization beginning with the tissue zonation of the adrenal cortex and how this impacts steroidogenic output we then discuss the cellular biology of steroidogenesis placing special emphasis on the mitochondria mitochondria are classically known as the powerhouses of the cell for their central role in respiratory adenosine triphosphate synthesis and attention is given to mitochondrial electron transport in both the context of mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial steroid metabolism building on work demonstrating functional assembly of large protein complexes in respiration we further review research demonstrating a role for multimeric protein complexes in mitochondrial cholesterol transport steroidogenesis and mitochondriaendoplasmic reticulum contact we aim to highlight with this review the shift in steroidogenic cell biology from a focus on the actions of individual proteins in isolation to the actions of protein assemblies working together to execute cellular functions
general spontaneous evaluations of strangers based on their faces have been shown to reflect judgments of these persons' intention and ability to harm these evaluations can be mapped onto a 2d space defined by the dimensions trustworthiness intention and dominance ability here we go beyond general evaluations and focus on more specific personality judgments derived from the big two and big five personality concepts in particular we investigate whether big two/big five personality judgments can be mapped onto the 2d space defined by the dimensions trustworthiness and dominance results indicate that judgments of the big two personality dimensions almost perfectly map onto the 2d space in contrast at least 3 of the big five dimensions ie neuroticism extraversion and conscientiousness go beyond the 2d space indicating that additional dimensions are necessary to describe more specific facebased personality judgments accurately building on this evidence we model the big two/big five personality dimensions in real facial photographs results from 2 validation studies show that the big two/big five are perceived reliably across different samples of faces and participants moreover results reveal that participants differentiate reliably between the different big two/big five dimensions importantly this high level of agreement and differentiation in personality judgments from faces likely creates a subjective reality which may have serious consequences for those being perceivednotably these consequences ensue because the subjective reality is socially shared irrespective of the judgments' validity the methodological approach introduced here might prove useful in various psychological disciplines

although objectification theory suggests that women frequently experience the objectifying gaze with many adverse consequences there is scant research examining the nature and causes of the objectifying gaze for perceivers the main purpose of this work was to examine the objectifying gaze toward women via eye tracking technology a secondary purpose was to examine the impact of body shape on this objectifying gaze to elicit the gaze we asked participants 29 women 36 men from a large midwestern university in the us to focus on the appearance vs personality of women and presented women with body shapes that fit cultural ideals of feminine attractiveness to varying degrees including high ideal ie hourglassshaped women with large breasts and small waisttohip ratios average ideal with average breasts and average waisttohip ratios and low ideal ie with small breasts and large waisttohip ratios consistent with our main hypothesis we found that participants focused on women's chests and waists more and faces less when they were appearancefocused vs personalityfocused moreover we found that this effect was particularly pronounced for women with high vs average and low ideal body shapes in line with hypotheses finally compared to female participants male participants showed an increased tendency to initially exhibit the objectifying gaze and they regarded women with high vs average and low ideal body shapes more positively regardless of whether they were appearancefocused or personalityfocused implications for objectification and person perception theories are discussed
largescale reactor calculations with monte carlo mc including nonlinear feedback effects have become a reality in the course of the last decade in particular implementations of coupled mc and thermalhydraulic th calculations have been separately developed by many different groups numerous mc codes have been coupled to a variety of th codes system level subchannel and computational fluid dynamics in this work we review the numerical methods that have been used to solve the coupled mcth problem with a particular focus on the formulation of the nonlinear problem convergence criteria and relaxation schemes used to ensure stability of the iterative process we use a simple pressurized water reactor pin cell problem to numerically investigate the stability of commonly used schemes and which problem parameters influence the stabilityor lack thereof we also examine the role that the running strategy used in the mc calculation plays in the convergence of the coupled calculation results indicate that the instability in fixedpoint iterations is driven by the doppler feedback effect and that underrelaxation can be used to restore stability we also observed that a form of underrelaxation could be achieved by performing the coupled iterations without converging the mc fission source each iteration by performing many iterations of few histories we observed rapid convergence to the coupled mcth solution in a relatively small number of batches numerical results also showed that the presence of instability in the fixedpoint iteration is independent of the stochastic noise in the mc simulation
purpose: researchers are increasingly using national population surveys nps to understand the health of gay and bisexual men gbm however valid inference from these surveys depends on accurate identification of gbm methods: we asked 8126 gbm in an anonymous online communityrecruited survey about their willingness to reveal their sexual orientation in nps results: overall 30% indicated that they would not reveal their sexual orientation; however there were differences in frequencies according to sexual orientation relationship status age hiv status living environment education income and ethnicity conclusion: nps might not be fully representative of gbm due to misclassification errors stemming from unwillingness to disclose
socioeconomic status ses has been consistently linked to poorer access utilization and outcomes of health care services but this relationship has been understudied in adolescent substance abuse treatment research this study examined ses differences in adolescent's treatment participation and longterm outcomes of abstinence and 12step attendance over five years after treatment data are from 358 adolescents ages 1318 who were recruited at intake to substance abuse treatment between 2000 and 2002 at four kaiser permanente northern california outpatient treatment programs followup interviews of adolescents and their parents were conducted at 1 3 and 5 years with over 80% response rates across time points using parent ses as a proxy for adolescent ses no socioeconomic differences were found in treatment initiation treatment retention or longterm abstinence from alcohol or drugs parent education but not parent income was significantly associated with 12 step attendance posttreatment such that adolescents with higher parent edification were more likely to attend than those with lower parent education findings suggest a lack of socioeconomic disparities in substance abuse treatment participation in adolescence but potential disparities in posttreatment 12step attendance during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

human metabolism of di 2ethylhexyl phthalate dehp was studied after a single oral dose of 481 mg to a male volunteer to avoid interference by background exposure the d4ringlabelled dehp analogue was dosed excretion of three metabolites mono 2ethyl5hydroxyhexyl phthalate 5ohmehp mono 2ethyl5oxohexyl phthalate 5oxomehp and mono 2ethylhexyl phthalate mehp was monitored for 44 h in urine and for 8 h in serum peak concentrations of all metabolites were found in serum after 2 h and in urine after 2 h mehp and after 4 h 5ohmehp and 5oxomehp while the major metabolite in serum was mehp the major metabolite in urine was 5ohmehp followed by 5oxomehp and mehp excretion in urine followed a multiphase elimination model after an absorption and distribution phase of 4 to 8 h halflife times of excretion in the first elimination phase were approximately 2 h with slightly higher halflife times for 5oh and 5oxomehp halflife times in the second phasebeginning 14 to 18 h post dosewere 5 h for mehp and 10 h for 5ohmehp and 5oxomehp in the time window 36 to 44 h no decrease in excreted concentrations of 5oh and 5oxomehp was observed in the first elimination phase 8 to 14 h post dose mean excretion ratios of mehp to 5oxomehp and mehp to 5ohmehp were 1 to 18 and 1 to 31 in the second elimination phase up to 24 h post dose mean excretion ratios of mehp to 5oxomehp to 5ohmehp were 1 to 50 to 93 the excretion ratio of 5ohmehp to 5oxomehp remained constant through time at 17 in the mean after 44 h 47% of the dehp dose was excreted in urine comprising mehp 73% 5ohmehp 247% and 5oxomehp 149%
the modern environmental awareness leads to the realisation that the human metabolism is stressed by a huge number of chemical substances generally these background exposures consisting predominantly from natural and partly from industrial as well as life style sources are tolerated without any adverse effects pesticides are chemicals intentionally introduced to the environment and have become necessities in modern agriculture as well as in indoor pest control their residues therefore is attracting more and more concern for the majority of pesticides neither occupational nor environmental medical risk evaluations are so far available therefore at the moment the occupational as well as the environmental supported preventive concept may only be achieved if binding instructions upon experience and guide values are developed for the assessment of the individual risk of handling pesticides in the occupational and environmental pesticide prophylaxis the ubiquitous background exposure levels in consideration with individual susceptibility factors should be recommended as provisional biological tolerance guide values the suitability of this guide values concept for pesticides is demonstrated by determining the background exposure and the biomarkers of susceptibility of 250 unexposed persons as well as of more than 1200 occupationally exposed persons as a result a significant dependence of their health fidelity from the background exposure profile impressed on the individual polymorphism of the key enzymes was observed especially the cumulative adducts of electrophilic substances and their metabolites with macromolecules like hsa and hb turned our to be sensitive markers for the capacity of the individual metabolic rate for alkylating and arylating pesticides the observed interindividual susceptibility to their adverse effects depends on the variability of the individual 'toxifying' and 'detoxifying' metabolic rates until scientific evaluation of official biological tolerance values for pesticides is carried out it is advisable for risk prophylaxis to orientate the assessment of any individual tolerable stress and strain from pesticides to the synergism between background exposure life style factors and biomarkers of specific susceptibility they may be examined by a monitoring of conjugates and polymorphism marked by the individual metabolic rate the monitoring and surveillance of pesticide exposures is mainly introduced by the recommendation of tolerable biological values from the reference value concept this concept is an essential contribution to an objective risk discussion with regard to individual stress and strain profiles in environmental exposure scenarios c 1999 elsevier science ireland ltd all rights reserved
epithelialtomesenchymal transition emt is associated with metastasis formation as well as with generation and maintenance of cancer stem cells in this way emt contributes to tumor invasion heterogeneity and chemoresistance morphological and functional changes involved in these processes require robust reprogramming of gene expression which is only partially accomplished at the transcriptional level alternative splicing is another essential layer of gene expression regulation that expands the cell proteome this step in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression tightly controls cell identity between epithelial and mesenchymal states and during stem cell differentiation importantly dysregulation of splicing factor function and cancerspecific splicing isoform expression frequently occurs in human tumors suggesting the importance of alternative splicing regulation for cancer biology in this review we briefly discuss the role of emt programs in development stem cell differentiation and cancer progression next we focus on selected examples of key factors involved in emt and stem cell differentiation that are regulated posttranscriptionally through alternative splicing mechanisms lastly we describe relevant oncogenic splicevariants that directly orchestrate cancer stem cell biology and tumor emt which may be envisioned as novel targets for therapeutic intervention

there is no universally accepted grading system to classify the severity of systemic allergic reactions sars including anaphylaxis although a consensus definition for anaphylaxis was established in 2005 the signs and symptoms required to define a reaction as anaphylaxis are inconsistently applied in research and clinical practice as a result it is difficult to compare and evaluate safety outcomes in surveys clinical practice and trials and pharmacovigilance data in 2010 the world allergy organization wao proposed a uniform grading system to classify allergen immunotherapy sars the basis of the grading system is the organ system s involved and reaction severity the final grade is determined by the physician/health care professional after the event is over although the 2010 wao grading system was developed to classify allergen immunotherapy sars with appropriate modifications it can be used to classify sars from any cause the purpose of this rostrum is to present a proposed modification of the 2010 wao sar grading system that will make it applicable to all sars due to any cause the modified grading system allows for classification of less severe sars which may be underreported or overreported in clinical trials and surveillance studies depending on the criteria specified for adverse event reporting the universal use of the proposed modified sar grading system will allow for better safety comparisons across different venues and treatment protocols c 2016 american academy of allergy asthma & immunology j allergy clin immunol pract 2017;5:5862
the human beings who manage global virtual teams regularly face challenges caused by factors such as the lack of a shared language and culture among team members and coordination delay resulting from spatial and temporal divisions between members of the team as part of the ongoing advances in artificial agent aa technology artificial agents have been developed whose purpose is to assist the human managers of virtual teams in this paper we move a step further by suggesting that new capabilities being developed for artificial agents will eventually give them the ability to successfully manage virtual teams whose other members are human beings in particular artificial agents will be uniquely positioned to take on roles as managers of crosscultural multilingual global virtual teams by overcoming some of the fundamental cognitive limitations that create obstacles for human beings serving in these managerial roles in order to effectively interact with human team members aas must be able to decode and encode the full spectrum of verbal and nonverbal communication used by human beings because culture is so deeply embedded in all human forms of communication aas cannot communicate in a way that is noncultural; an aa that is capable of communicating effectively with human team members will necessarily display a particular culture or mix of cultures just as human beings do already researchers have designed aas that can display diverse cultural behaviors through their use of language intonation gaze posture emotion and personality the need for aa team leaders to display cultural behavior raises the key question of which culture or cultures the aa leader of a particular human virtual team should display we argue that the answer to this question depends on both the cultural makeup of a team's human members and the methods used to share information among team members to facilitate the analysis of how an aa team leader's cultural behaviors can best be structured to fit the circumstances of a particular virtual team we propose a twodimensional model for designing suites of cultural behaviors for aas that will manage human virtual teams the first dimension describes whether an aa deploys the same cultural behaviors for its dealings with all team members objectivity or customizes its cultural display for each team member personalization the second dimension describes whether the aa always displays the same culture to a given team member invariance or possesses a repertoire of cultural guises for a particular team member from which it chooses one to fit the current situation situationality the two dimensions of objectivepersonalized and invariantsituational cultural behaviors yield four archetypes for aas leading virtual human teams we consider examples of each type of aa identify potential strengths and weaknesses of each type suggest particular kinds of virtual teams that are likely to benefit from being managed by aas of the different types and discuss empirical study that can test the validity and usefulness of this framework
due to limited resources of actors thirdparty auditing has vital significance for ambient intelligence systems which ensures the integrity of data stored in the information manager however current public key based thirdparty auditing schemes are costly while simple mac based thirdparty auditing schemes can't fulfill two security requirements namely the privacypreserving and the integrityagainsttpa requirements taking both security and efficiency into account this paper proposes a novel simple mac based thirdparty auditing scheme which is much more efficient than current public key based schemes while still fulfills the above two security requirements therefore it is feasible to be deployed in ambient intelligence systems
the mek ong river is ranked as the 8th in terms of water discharge and as the 10th in terms of sediment load in the world during the last 4500 years its delta prograded more than 250 km to the south due to a tremendous amount of sediments deposited and turned from a tidedominated delta into a waveandtide dominated delta this study aims at completing our knowledge on the fate of sediments that may be stored in estuarine or coastal systems or dispersed over the continental shelf and slope sediment transport in the mekong river delta mrd coastal area was studied by numerical simulations using the delft3d model the model configuration was calibrated and validated from data collected in situ during 4 periods from 2012 to 2014 then 50 scenarios corresponding to different wave conditions derived from the wave climate and river discharge values typical of low flow and flood seasons enabled us to quantify the dispersal patterns of fluvial sediments close to the mouths and along the coast sediments mostly settled in the estuary and close to the mouths under calm conditions and suspended sediment with higher concentrations extend further offshore with higher waves waves from the southeast enhanced the concentration all along the mrd coastal zone waves from the south and southwest induced coastal erosion higher suspended sediment concentrations in front of the southern delta and a net transport towards the northeast of the delta because of episodes of southern and southwestern waves during the low flow season the net alongshore suspended sediment transport is oriented northeastward and decreases from the southwestern part of the coastal zone similar to 960 x 10 3 t yr 1 to the northeastern part similar to 650 x 10 3 t yr 1

a networking laboratory is an essential tool for teaching communications engineering however the effort and cost invested in creating a networking laboratory with physical equipment are significantly high especially if the students are to work on realistic scenarios by substituting physical networking devices by virtualized ones virtualization technologies may contribute to simplify the laboratory management tasks and allow the creation of affordable and more complex network scenarios in this way students can work and experiment on realistic network scenarios so that their learning experience is greatly improved in this paper a detailed description of a virtualizationbased networking laboratory model evolved over the last 10 years of authors experience in teaching computer networking is provided this laboratory model is implemented using virtual networks over linux vnx an open source tool specifically designed and developed to define build deploy and manage networking scenarios taking full advantage of virtualization and supporting hybrid virtual/physical scenarios and heterogeneous operating systems the features of the vnx tool illustrated with an example of a complex network scenario used by more than 300 students are described a surveybased assessment of the usage experience of vnx is included in the paper showing the validity and efficacy of the proposed laboratory model and of the vnx tool for teaching computer networking in laboratory assignments
in assessing the distribution and metabolism of toxic compounds in the body measurements are not always feasible for ethical or technical reasons computer modeling offers a reasonable alternative but the variability and complexity of biological systems pose unique challenges in model building and adjustment recent tools from population pharmacokinetics bayesian statistical inference and physiological modeling can be brought together to solve these problems as an example we modeled the distribution and metabolism of tetrachloroethylene perc in humans we derive statistical distributions for the parameters of a physiological model of perc on the basis of data from monster et al 1979 the model adequately fits both prior physiological information and experimental data an estimate of the relationship between perc exposure and fraction metabolized is obtained our median population estimate for the fraction of inhaled tetrachloroethylene that is metabolized at exposure levels exceeding current occupational standards is 15% 95% confidence interval 052% 41% at levels approaching ambient inhalation exposure 0001 ppm the median estimate of the fraction metabolized is much higher at 36% 95% confidence interval 15% 58% this disproportionality should be taken into account when deriving safe exposure limits for tetrachloroethylene and deserves to be verified by further experiments

children's prosociality emerges early in life which suggests that helping others is rooted deeply in human nature at the same time the motivation underlying young children's instrumental helping poses a puzzle children do not express a specific emotion such as sympathy when removing physical obstacles for others instead of being motivated by a concern for others' wellbeing toddlers may act to tie up loose ends or engage in social interactions or they may be motivated because their goals align with those of others recent research has addressed the underlying motivation of children's helping by directly measuring children's internal arousal via changes in the dilation of their pupils in several studies children's arousal in response to others' unfulfilled needs is genuinely prosocial and linked to the wellbeing of others this prosocial arousal may lie at the heart of not only children's instrumental helping but also their prosociality in general
despite advances in molecular biology imaging and treatment gastric neoplasms remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality; gastric adenocarcinoma is the fifth most common malignancy and third most common cause of death worldwide brenner et al methods mol biol 472:467477 2009; howson et al epidemiol rev 8:127 1986; roder gastric cancer 5 suppl 1 :511 2002; ferlay et al globocan 2012 v10 cancer incidence and mortality worldwide: iarc cancerbase no 11 internet international agency for research on cancer 2013 because of both the frequency at which malignant gastric tumors occur as well as the worldwide impact gastric neoplasms remain important lesions to identify and characterize on all imaging modalities despite the varied histologies and behaviors of these neoplasms many have similar imaging features nonetheless the treatment management and prognosis of gastric neoplasms vary by pathology so it is essential for the radiologist to make every effort to differentiate between these lesions and raise the less common entities as differential diagnostic considerations when appropriate
the evolution and increasing commoditization of home and building automation systems hbas is contributing to their widespread adoption however an effort must still be made to render them usable intelligent highly adaptive and able to fulfill users' needs when distinct users interact with such a system their intentions are likely to be different often resulting in conflicting situations which the system ought to recognize and if possible resolve automatically however conflict detection and resolution in hbas are not yet fully understood this work aims at investigating conflict in ambient intelligence systems namely those supported by hbas our main contribution is a systematization and review of existing literature concerning conflict detection and resolution in these systems
this study aims to conduct the nonlinearity analysis of the shading effect on the technicaleconomic performance of the buildingintegrated photovoltaic blind bipb which is designed as a preliminary study to evaluate the feasibility of the bipb before its implementation first in terms of the technical performance of the bipb the shading effect due to the blind's slat in the bipb can have a nonlinear effect on the amount of electricity generation per unit area aegunit from the bipb particularly as the width of the pv panel increases the aeg unit from the bipb tends to decrease second in terms of the economic performance of the bipb the feasibility of the bipb depends on the type of investment values specifically as' the width of the pv panel increases the npv25 net present value at year 25 tends to increase; however the sir25 savingtoinvestment ratio at year 25 tends to decrease that is while the npv25 is determined to be highest at us$82 869 when the width of the pv panel is 50 mm the sir25 is determined to be highest at 290 times when the width of the pv panel is 10 mm the main findings of this study can be used to clearly define the design specifications of the bipb before its implementation which ensure to meet the client expectations on various objectives such as technical performance eg the aeg unit from the bipb and economic performance eg npv25 and sir25 c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
mitochondrial dna mtdna variation has been implicated in many common complex diseases but inconsistent and contradicting results are common here we introduce a novel mutational load hypothesis which also considers the collective effect of mainly rare variants utilising the mutpred program we apply this new methodology to investigate the possible role of mtdna in two cardiovascular disease cvd phenotypes hypertension and hyperglycaemia within a twopopulation cohort n 363; mean age 45 +/ 9 yrs very few studies have looked at african mtdna variation in the context of complex disease and none using complete sequence data in a wellphenotyped cohort as such our study will also extend our knowledge of african mtdna variation with complete sequences of southern africans being especially underrepresented the cohort showed prevalence rates for hypertension 586% and prediabetes 448% we could not identify a statistically significant role for mtdna variation in association with hypertension or hyperglycaemia in our cohort however we are of the opinion that the method described will find wide application in the field being especially useful for cohorts from multiple locations or with a variety of mtdna lineages where the traditional haplogroup association method has been particularly likely to generate spurious results in the context of association with common complex disease copyright c 2017 institute of genetics and developmental biology chinese academy of sciences and genetics society of china published by elsevier limited and science press all rights reserved
natural killer cells were first described over 40 years ago but the last 15 years has shown tremendous progress in our understanding of their biology and our ability to manipulate them for clinical therapeutic effect despite the increased understanding by clinicians and scientists investigating these cells their biology remains a confusing subject for many because of the wide array of receptors complex interactions multiple models of predicting function and contradictory data in the literature while they are microscopically indistinguishable from t cells and share many of the same effector functions their mechanisms of target recognition are completely distinct from yet complimentary to t cells in this review we provide a basic understanding of nk cell biology and hla recognition as compared and contrasted to t cells using a metaphor of border patrol and passports we conclude with a summary of the evidence for nm cell effects in hematologic malignancies and describe new advances in nm cell immunotherapy aimed at improving these effects c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the changing land use due to rapid urbanization has profound impact on the runoff in urban watersheds the spatial analysis in urban watersheds is felt necessary for management of surface and subsurface water regimes significant increase in impervious zones was observed in nagpur urban watersheds between 2000 and 2012 having impacts on runoff and even flash floods were observed this study presents spatial and temporal impacts of change in urban builtup area on curve number cn and runoff during the years 2000 and 2012 the study also analyzes effect of slope on cn values and shows that cn increases with slope highresolution satellite images were used to map impervious surface areas isas which show an increase of 09 to 34 % during 20002012 spearman's and pearson's coefficients have been generated to establish relationship between runoff impervious surface areas vegetation index slope and runoff coefficient it has been hypothetically assumed that if 100 50 and 25 % rooftop rainwater harvesting is considered the estimated runoff reduces in 2012 as compared to the year 2000 the study suggests that increase in impervious areas within urban watersheds can be utilized for groundwater augmentation adopting rooftop rainwaterharvesting techniques and to prevent flash floods
understanding how people form impressions of others is a key goal of social cognition research past theories have posited that two fundamental dimensionswarmth and competenceunderlie impression formation however these models conflate morality with warmth and fail to capture the full role that moral character plays in impression formation an emerging perspective separates moral character or morality from warmth on both theoretical and empirical grounds when morality is pitted against warmth morality is clearly a more important driver of impression formation as revealed by correlational experimental and archival studies yet social warmth remains important and conveys distinct information that morality does not alongside competence both factors matter not only for person perception but also for other aspects of social cognition including group perception important unanswered questions remain regarding the perceived structure of moral character and the way it is appraised in everyday life
sometimes our automatic evaluations do not correspond well with those we can reflect on and articulate we present a novel approach to the assessment of automatic and reflective affective evaluations of exercising based on the assumptions of the associativepropositional processes in evaluation model we measured participants' automatic evaluations of exercise and then shared this information with them asked them to reflect on it and rate eventual discrepancy between their reflective evaluation and the assessment of their automatic evaluation we found that mismatch between selfreported ideal exercise frequency and actual exercise frequency over the previous 14 weeks could be regressed on the discrepancy between a relatively negative automatic and a more positive reflective evaluation this study illustrates the potential of a dualprocess approach to the measurement of evaluative responses and suggests that mistrusting one's negative spontaneous reaction to exercise and asserting a very positive reflective evaluation instead leads to the adoption of inflated exercise goals
in the present work we compare the results obtained by two approaches to detect receptor expression on cells surface: i the confocal laser scanning microscopy which is an established methodology to study cell biology and associated events wherein the cells or molecules labeling is needed and ii an alternative labelfree electroanalytical technique essentially quantitative based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis concerning specificity both assays are equivalent since they depend on the antibody efficiency to recognize and discriminate the searched structure in the cell context regarding sensitivity we showed that in the case of the detection of tolllike receptor on transfected human cells this labelfree eis approach with measurements performed on 2% of paraformaldehyde an environment that retained morphology and antigenic sites of cells was very sensitive for the receptor detection in a demonstration that the proposed electrical impedance analytical assays can help optimizing the ability to evaluate cellular biological events it provides to biologists and medical community an alternative and either quantitive analytical tool that can be applied to the biological model of interest and used to design and perform a rapid multiplexable and automatable assaying methodology c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
stormwater quality modeling has arisen as a promising tool to develop mitigation strategies the aim of this paper is to assess the buildup and washoff processes and investigate the capacity of several water quality models to accurately simulate and predict the temporal variability of suspended solids concentrations in runoff based on a longterm data set a markov chain montecarlo mcmc technique is applied to calibrate the models and analyze the parameter's uncertainty the shortterm predictive capacity of the models is assessed based on interand intraevent approaches results suggest that the performance of the washoff model is related to the dynamic of pollutant transport where the best fit is recorded for first flush events assessment of swmm storm water management model exponential buildup model reveals that better performance is obtained on short periods and that buildup models relying only on the antecedent dry weather period as an explanatory variable cannot predict satisfactorily the accumulated mass on the surface the predictive interevent capacity of swmm exponential model proves its inability to predict the pollutograph while the intraevent approach based on data assimilation proves its efficiency for first flush events only this method is very interesting for management practices because of its simplicity and easy implementation
domestic rainwater harvesting drwh is widely recognized as an alternative source of water in taiwan because of water shortages this suggests that rainwater potential should be maximized and quantified in this article we assess the potential of drwh at a national level to consider the climatic building characteristic economic and ecological aspects of drwh we propose three categories: 1 theoretical; 2 available; and 3 environmental bearable rainwater potential four main steps were followed to develop the proposed framework: 1 fifteen rainfall zones across taiwan were generated through cluster analysis based on the average annual 10day rainfall distributions of rainfall stations and administrative districts; 2 the roof area in each rainfall zone was estimated using a geographic information system gis and land use classification database; 3 the weighted percentage of rainwater use in each rainfall zone was determined by the optimal point on the storage capacity and rainwater supply reliability curve for an equivalent building from each building type; 4 the percentage of the total roof area used to harvest rainwater in each region depends on the downstream impact of the stream flow the procedures developed in this study constitute an effective tool for preliminarily estimation of the national drwh potential
fregoli delusion is the mistaken belief that some person currently present in the deluded person's environment typically a stranger is a familiar person in disguise the stranger is believed to be psychologically identical to this known person who is not present even though the deluded person perceives the physical appearance of the stranger as being different from the known person's typical appearance to gain a deeper understanding of this contradictory error in the normal system for tracking and identifying known persons we conducted a detailed survey of all the fregoli cases reported in the literature since the seminal courbon and fail 1927 paper our preliminary reading of these cases revealed a notable lack of definitional clarity so we first formulated a classification scheme of different person misidentification delusions so as to identify those cases that qualified as instances of fregoli according to the above characterization: the mistaken belief that a known person is present in the environment in a different guise to his or her typical appearance we identified 38 clear cases of this type and set out to answer a series of questions motivated by current hypotheses about the origin of the fregoli delusion we asked whether the patients misidentified particular strangers made reference to the misidentified known persons using wigs or plastic surgery or other techniques to disguise their appearance misidentified many different strangers or only one showed other symptoms in particular other misidentification delusions and made inferences about the motives of the known persons in disguise we conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for current hypotheses concerning the origin of the fregoli delusion

in gentry's fully homomorphic encryption scheme a sparse subset sum problem sssp is used and a big set is included in the public key in the implementation of a variant to reduce the size of the public key gentry and halevi used a specific form of a sssp constructed from geometric progressions in this study the authors solve gentry and halevi's sparse subset sum challenges for the first time owing to the aggressive choice of parameters the process is fairly easy and can be done by simply modifying their latticebased attack their experiment shows that even a large challenge can be solved within two days as a second contribution considering other attacks such as a hybrid attack combining a meet in the middle attack with a latticebased attack they provide a new condition for hard instances of the sssp from geometric progressions
background: some copd patients are more susceptible to exacerbations than others mechanisms underlying these differences in susceptibility are not well understood we hypothesized that altered cell mediated immune responses may underlie a propensity to suffer from frequent exacerbations in copd methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs were obtained from 24 stable copd patients eight frequent exacerbators >3 diarycard exacerbations/year and 16 infrequent exacerbators < 3 diarycard exacerbations/year detailed multiparameter flow cytometry was used to study differences in innate and adaptive systemic immune function between frequent and infrequently exacerbating copd patients results: the 24 copd patients had a mean sd age of 763 94 years and fev1 143 060 l 533 183 % predicted pbmcs of frequent exacerbators fe contained lower frequencies of cd4+ t central memory cells cd4+ tcm compared to infrequent exacerbators ie fe 187 %; ie 239 %; p 0035 this observation was also apparent in absolute numbers of cd4+ tcm cells fe 017 x 10 lambda 6/ml; ie 025 x 10 lambda 6/ml; p 0035 pbmcs of fe contained a lower frequency of cd8+ t effector memory cells expressing hladr human leukocyte antigen d related compared to ie copd patients fe 227 %; ie 315 %; p 0007 conclusion: differences in the adaptive systemic immune system might associate with exacerbation susceptibility in the `frequent exacerbator' copd phenotype these differences include fewer cd4+ t central memory cells and cd8+ t effector memory cells
field trials were conducted under natural infection and artificial inoculation from 2012 to 2014 at seven sites across the canadian prairies to determine genetic and management effects on fusarium head blight fhb in wheat production systems a system of management which consisted of 1 a control of no fungicide was compared with 2 the seed treatment st thiamethoxam + difenoconazole + metalaxylm + sisomer 3 an incrop foliar fungicide tebuconazole + prothioconazole or 4 st + foliar fungicide was integrated with four wheat cultivars of contrasting growth habits and levels of fhb resistance results indicated the cultivars expressing improved fhb resistance carberry spring wheat and emerson winter wheat were superior over susceptible cultivars harvest spring wheat and cdc falcon winter wheat in reducing fusariumdamaged kernel fdk and deoxynivalenol don levels and displayed higher yield under high fusarium pressure winter wheat displayed higher overall yield with emerson producing the highest and most stable yields across environments application of foliar fungicide with or without the st increased grain yield seed mass and test weight; and lowered fdk and don seed treatment alone increased test weight spring plant density of both winter wheat varieties and kernel weight in emerson a management strategy of foliar fungicide and or st + foliar fungicide generally produced higher yields with greater stability particularly for susceptible cultivars in high fhb environments the results of this study reinforce that integration of fhbresistant cultivars with appropriate cultural practices is required to reduce the risk of fhb and optimize grain yield and is further enhanced with a winter vs spring growth habit
we study load balancing in wireless networks with a single class of traffic focusing our attention on an important example ie wireless sensor networks the analysis is based on the wireless minimum cost problem an optimization problem that implicitly captures the effects of interference through the novel use of an arc cost function that depends on the amount of traffic flowing through nearby links we present an algorithm that optimizes the flow by modifying the traffic along cycles constructed during an initialization phase its operation may be viewed as trying to satisfy kirchhoff's voltage law on an electric circuit containing interferistors it is robust distributed with minimal communication overhead and converges quickly furthermore when the traffic is elastic the algorithm can be easily modified to also perform congestion control
in a digital control system the dependency model between the actions of operators differs from that in a conventional control room because information sharing and the main control room mcr operations are team operations dependencies between the actions of operators are more common in a digital control system compared with a conventional control room because operators share the same information and mcr operations are directed by team decisions therefore assessing the dependencies between operators is an important aspect of human reliability analysis in this study we use a fuzzy logicbased approach to evaluate the dependencies among the actions of operators in the present study first the factors that influence the dependency levels among the actions of operators are identified by analyzing the characteristic human factors in a digital control system and an analytical model of the dependencies is then constructed second a method for analyzing the dependencies between the actions of operators is established based on a fuzzy logic approach this method can simulate vague and uncertain knowledge but it also provides a clear explanation of the origins of results and their reasoning process by tracing the steps in reasoning therefore traceability and repeatability are characteristics of the proposed method third we present a case study to demonstrate the proposed approach finally we demonstrate that the results obtained are reasonable and that the established model is stable based on validations that involve data comparisons and a sensitivity analysis of the model c 2015 elsevier bv all rights reserved
cultivating empathy is a presumed benefit of mindfulness but this possibility has rarely been investigated experimentally we examined whether a fiveminute mindfulness exercise would cultivate empathy relative to two equally brief control exercises: relaxation and mindwandering we further examined whether mindfulness would be especially beneficial for people with autistic or narcissistic traits results showed no effect of mindfulness relative to both control conditions on mind reading empathic responding or prosocial behavior mindfulness effects were independent of autistic traits unexpectedly people higher in autistic traits did show increased prosocial behavior across conditions intriguingly mindfulness improved mind reading in nonnarcissistic people but reduced it in narcissistic people these findings question whether a brief mindfulness exercise is sufficient for building empathy
background: aggression comprises a heterogeneous set of behavioral patterns that aim to harm and hurt others empathy represents a potential mechanism that inhibits aggressive conduct and enhances prosocial behavior nevertheless research results on the relationship between empathy and aggression are mixed subtypes of aggressive behavior such as reactive and proactive aggression might be differently related to empathy the aim of the present study was to investigate the interrelations of cognitive and affective empathy with reactive and proactive aggression methods: we recruited a sample of 177 33% female m age 156 adolescents from socioeducational and juvenile justice institutions and a community sample of 77 36% female m age 131 adolescents from secondary schools using bivariate correlation analysis and hierarchical multiple regression analysis we firstly investigated associations between cognitive and affective empathy and reactive and proactive aggression subsequently we performed cluster analysis to identify clusters of adolescents with meaningful profiles of aggressive behavior and compared derived clusters on measures of empathy we applied the basic empathy scale and the reactiveproactive aggression questionnaire results: bivariate analysis and hierarchical regression analysis showed that cognitive and affective empathy were negatively associated with proactive aggression but not with reactive aggression clusteranalysis revealed three clusters of adolescents with distinct aggression profiles: a cluster with elevated scores on reactive and proactive aggression a clusters with high scores on reactive aggression only and a low aggression cluster cluster comparisons revealed that the reactiveproactive aggression cluster showed significantly lower scores on cognitive and affective empathy than both other clusters results further indicated that within the reactiveproactive aggression cluster girls did not differ significantly from boys in empathy conclusions: the present study extends previously published findings and possibly explains conflicting results in prior research our results indicated that cognitive and affective empathy are reduced in adolescents with high levels of reactive and proactive aggression our study may contribute to the development of tailored clinical interventions for different aggression clusters
hybrid microgrids are expected to play an important role in the expansion of access to electricity in developing countries while most of these systems are operated with dispatch strategies which do not make use of predictions about the load or about the availability of renewable energy resources forecastbased strategies have recently gained attention as an alternative to bring down operation costs in this work we develop a framework to assess this potential under a range of assumptions about the quality of load and photovoltaic generation forecasts the application of the methodology to a village of 600 households reveals cost savings ranging between 2% and 7% depending on the forecast quality and the composition of the microgrid we also show that sizing microgrid components under the assumption of a predictive operation strategy results in a design with a higher share of intermittent generation c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

metacognition refers to a range of cognitive processes that allow one to form complex ideas of self and others and to use this information to navigate psychosocial challenges several studies in both earlyphase and prolonged schizophrenia have demonstrated not only that significant deficits in metacognitive ability are present but importantly that they are associated with significant functional impairment and decreased quality of life in spite of the importance of metacognitive impairment in schizophrenia relatively little is known about the biological substrates that may contribute to this dysfunction in this study we examined the relationship between resting state functional connectivity of the medial prefrontal cortex mpfc a structure shown in prior voxelbased morphometry studies to be associated with metacognition with metacognitive function in an early phase psychosis cohort n18 analyses revealed a positive association of resting state functional connectivity between the mpfc and precuneus and posterior cingulate structures and metacognitive ability these results provide evidence of disrupted resting state connectivity in structures relevant to metacognitive dysfunction in earlyphase psychosis which may have implications for pathophysiological models of complex cognitive deficits in this illness
the textile industry is one of the largest sectors globally representing up to 20% of industrial water pollution however there is limited insight into how fluvial ecosystems respond and recover from this impact from summer 2012 to spring 2013 we examined water quality and ecological status upstream and 15 km downstream the input of a textile industry wastewater treatment plant wwtp in ripoll river ne spain the ecological status was determined via diversity measures and 10 biotic indices based on diatoms macrophytes macroinvertebrates and fish our results showed that the wwtp severely deteriorated water quality and biological communities at the discharge site but that they improved at 15 km downstream severity also varied across taxa and seasons being fish the most affected taxa and spring the season with the best ecological status the strong correlation amongst water quality variables and many biotic indices across taxa indicated that this is a chronic pollution event affecting multiple trophic levels thus this study suggests that there is an urgent need to invest in wastewater treatment in this industry to preserve the ecological integrity of ripoll river and especially its fish fauna likewise it illustrates the diagnostic power of biotic indices based on diatoms macroinvertebrates and fish as driven by the european water framework directive c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
constraintsbased modeling is an emergent area in systems biology that includes an increasing set of methods for the analysis of metabolic networks in order to refine its predictions the development of novel methods integrating highthroughput experimental data is currently a key challenge in the field in this paper we present a novel set of constraints that integrate tracerbased metabolomics data from isotope labeling experiments and metabolic fluxes in a linear fashion these constraints are based on elementary carbon modes ecms a recently developed concept that generalizes elementary flux modes at the carbon level to illustrate the effect of our ecmsbased constraints a flux variability analysis approach was applied to a previously published metabolic network involving the main pathways in the metabolism of glucose the addition of our ecmsbased constraints substantially reduced the underdetermination resulting from a standard application of flux variability analysis which shows a clear progress over the state of the art in addition our approach is adjusted to deal with combinatorial explosion of ecms in genomescale metabolic networks this extension was applied to infer the maximum biosynthetic capacity of nonessential amino acids in human metabolism finally as linearity is the hallmark of our approach its importance is discussed at a methodological computational and theoretical level and illustrated with a practical application in the field of isotope labeling experiments c 2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved
in many digital control systems it is required to perform computation in a strictly periodic fashion to provide high control performance system designers need to assign time slots that are infinitely repeated given a strict period for each task such that the time slots of different tasks do not overlap while previous work has studied how to decide if a system is schedulable with a certain time slot assignment it is still an unexplored area of how to select time slots for strictly periodic tasks to make them schedulable in this paper we propose an efficient method to solve the above problem our method explores the relations among task periods to improve the possibility of finding feasible start time configurations finally we conduct experiments with randomly generated workload to evaluate the performance of the proposed method c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
this was a study on the perceived enjoyment of different movie genres in an online experiment 176 students were randomly divided into two groups n 88 and asked to estimate how much they their closest friends and young people in general enjoyed either serious or lighthearted movies these selfother differences in perceived enjoyment of serious or lighthearted movies were also assessed as a function of differing individual motivations underlying entertainment media consumption the results showed a clear thirdperson effect for lighthearted movies and a firstperson effect for serious movies the thirdperson effect for lighthearted movies was moderated by level of hedonic motivation as participants with high hedonic motivations did not perceive their own and others' enjoyment of lighthearted films differently however eudaimonic motivations did not moderate firstperson perceptions in the case of serious films
titan is the only moon with a substantial atmosphere the only other thick n2 atmosphere besides earth's the site of extraordinarily complex atmospheric chemistry that far surpasses any other solar system atmosphere and the only other solar system body with stable liquid currently on its surface the connection between titan's surface and atmosphere is also unique in our solar system; atmospheric chemistry produces materials that are deposited on the surface and subsequently altered by surfaceatmosphere interactions such as aeolian and fluvial processes resulting in the formation of extensive dune fields and expansive lakes and seas titan's atmosphere is favorable for organic haze formation which combined with the presence of some oxygenbearing molecules indicates that titan's atmosphere may produce molecules of prebiotic interest the combination of organics and liquid in the form of water in a subsurface ocean and methane/ethane in the surface lakes and seas means that titan may be the ideal place in the solar system to test ideas about habitability prebiotic chemistry and the ubiquity and diversity of life in the universe the cassinihuygens mission to the saturn system has provided a wealth of new information allowing for study of titan as a complex system here i review our current understanding of titan's atmosphere and climate forged from the powerful combination of earthbased observations remote sensing and in situ spacecraft measurements laboratory experiments and models i conclude with some of our remaining unanswered questions as the incredible era of exploration with cassinihuygens comes to an end plain language summary titan the largest moon of saturn is unique in our solar system it is the only moon with a dense atmosphere and the only other thick nitrogen atmosphere besides that of earth in the atmosphere very complicated chemistry started by sunlight forms molecules made of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen sometimes called organic molecules ; these molecules end up on the surface where they are moved by wind and rain to form dunes lakes and seas it is the only world besides earth that has lakes and seas presently on its surface although they are made of liquid methane and ethane instead of water the conditions in titan's atmosphere are ideal for creation of smoglike particles called haze which may have molecules that are important for the origin of life the combination of liquid and organics means that titan may be the best place in the solar system to test ideas about how life begins and how common it is in the universe the cassinihuygens mission to the saturn system has provided a wealth of new information allowing us to study titan as a system here i review our current understanding of titan's atmosphere and climate forged from the powerful combination of earthbased observations measurements from spacecraft laboratory experiments and computer models i conclude with some of our remaining unanswered questions as the incredible era of exploration with cassinihuygens comes to an end

oscillometric measurement is widely used to estimate systolic blood pressure sbp and diastolic blood pressure dbp in this paper we propose a deep belief network dbn deep neural network dnn to learn about the complex nonlinear relationship between the artificial feature vectors obtained from the oscillometric wave and the reference nurse blood pressures using the dbndnnbasedregression model our dbndnn is a powerful generative network for feature extraction and can address to stick in local minima through a special pretraining phase therefore this model provides an alternative way for replacing a popular shallow model based on this we apply the dbndnnbased regression model to estimate the sbp and dbp however there are a small amount of data samples which is not enough to train the dbndnn without the overfitting problem for this reason we use the parametric bootstrapbased artificial features which are used as training samples to efficiently learn the complex nonlinear functions between the feature vectors obtained and the reference nurse blood pressures as far as we know this is one of the first studies using the dbndnnbased regression model for bp estimation when a small training sample is available our dbndnnbased regression model provides a lower standard deviation of error mean error and mean absolute error for the sbp and dbp as compared with the conventional methods
with the rapid development of mobile communications technologies social apps eg line wechat have emerged as important communication tools although social apps provide people with additional convenience overuse of such applications may have negative life effects such as technostress and distraction past research has indicated that personality attributes contribute to compulsive usage this study explores the relationships between personality attributes and compulsive usage of social apps and examines the impact of technostress on academic performance a total of 136 valid questionnaires were collected from university students through an online survey fourteen proposed hypotheses were examined using smartpls software the results indicate that extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism have significant effects on compulsive usage of mobile social applications compulsive usage had a significant positive impact on technostress but did not negatively affect academic selfperception and course grades in addition conscientiousness significantly influenced academic selfperception unexpectedly gender and number of friends had little influence on technostress or compulsive usage the implications of these findings are discussed and directions for future research are offered c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
a social information processing sip theory of parenting risk posits that socialcognitive and neurocognitive incapacities characterize atrisk parents and that these cognitive difficulties operate across relational domains this study focused on highly disadvantaged mothers of preschoolers and compared mothers with histories of perpetrating child neglect n 69 to demographically similar mothers without such histories n 76 participants completed measures of unrealistic expectations for children and other adults social problemsolving in parenting and nonparenting situations executive functioning ef and attributions for children and other adults as predicted associations among these measures were found within and across relational domains exploratory factor analysis revealed two distinct clusters that distinguished the two groups the first included measures of expectations and attributions for both children and other adults and the second included problemsolving difficulties and ef when group differences were examined on individual variables mothers with histories of perpetrating neglect exhibited more unrealistic expectations of children and other adults more hostile attributions toward children and other adults and poorer performance on tests of ef than comparisons only interpersonal problemsolving in both parenting and nonparenting situations failed to differentiate the neglect group from comparisons in regression analyses both parenting and nonparenting social cognition and ef contributed significantly to child neglect these findings provide some support for this cognitive model of parenting risk and suggest widespread disturbances in parenting and nonparenting social cognition and neurocognition may play a role in child neglect
in recent work baez fong and the author introduced a framework for describing markov processes equipped with a detailed balanced equilibrium as open systems of a certain type these open markov processes serve as the building blocks for more complicated processes in this paper we describe the potential application of this framework in the modeling of biological systems as open systems maintained away from equilibrium we show that nonequilibrium steady states emerge in open systems of this type even when the rates of the underlying process are such that a detailed balanced equilibrium is permitted it is shown that these nonequilibrium steady states minimize a quadratic form which we call dissipation in some circumstances the dissipation is approximately equal to the rate of change of relative entropy plus a correction term on the other hand prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production generally fails for nonequilibrium steady states we use a simple model of membrane transport to illustrate these concepts
more than 40 years of research have shown that people favor members of their ingroup in their impressions attitudes and behaviors here we propose that people also form different mental images of minimal ingroup and outgroup members and we test the hypothesis that differences in these mental images contribute to the wellestablished biases that arise from minimal group categorization in study 1 participants were assigned to 1 of 2 groups using a classic minimal group paradigm next a reverse correlation image classification procedure was used to create visual renderings of ingroup and outgroup face representations subsequently a 2nd sample naive to the face generation stage rated these faces on a series of trait dimensions the results indicated that the ingroup face was significantly more likely than the outgroup face to elicit favorable impressions e g trusting caring intelligent attractive extending this finding study 2 revealed that ingroup face representations elicited more favorable implicitly measured attitudes than did outgroup representations and study 3 showed that ingroup faces were trusted more than outgroup faces during an economic game finally study 4 demonstrated that facial physiognomy associated with trustworthiness more closely resembled the facial structure of the average ingroup than outgroup face representation together these studies suggest that minimal group distinctions can elicit different mental representations and that this visual bias is sufficient to elicit ingroup favoritism in impressions attitudes and behaviors
increased enterococcal infections in hospitals and multidrugresistant and vancomycinresistant enterococci vre isolated from humans animals and food sources raised public health concern on the presence of vre in multiple sources we performed a comparative analysis of the antimicrobial resistance and genetics of vre isolates derived from fresh produce and human fecal samples of 389 enterococcus isolates 8 fecal and 3 produce isolates were resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin; all harbored vana gene the vre isolates showed multidrugresistant properties the isolates from fresh produce in this study showed to have the common shared characteristics with the isolates from humans by the results of antimicrobial resistance multilocus sequence typing and tn 1546 transposon analysis therefore vre isolates from fresh produce are likely related to vre derived from humans the results suggested that vre may contaminate vegetables through the environment and the contaminated vegetables could then act as a vehicle for human infections ongoing nationwide surveillance of antibiotic resistance and the promotion of the proper use of antibiotics are necessary
stick balancing on the fingertip is a complex voluntary motor task that requires the stabilization of an unstable system for seated expert stick balancers the time delay is 023 s the shortest stick that can be balanced for 240 s is 032 m and there is a approximate to 08 degrees dead zone for the estimation of the vertical displacement angle in the saggital plane these observations motivate a switchingtype pendulumcart model for balance control which uses an internal model to compensate for the time delay by predicting the sensory consequences of the stick's movements numerical simulations using the semidiscretization method suggest that the feedback gains are tuned near the edge of stability for these choices of the feedback gains the cost function which takes into account the position of the fingertip and the corrective forces is minimized thus expert stick balancers optimize control with a combination of quick manoeuvrability and minimum energy expenditures
the aim of this study was to investigate the overall root/shoot allocation of metal contaminants the amount of metal removal by absorption and adsorption within or on the external root surfaces the doseresponse of water hyacinth metal uptake and phytotoxicity this was examined in a singlemetal tub trial using arsenic as gold au copper cu iron fe mercury hg manganese mn uranium u and zinc zn iron and mn were also used in low medium and highconcentration treatments to test their dose effect on water hyacinth's metal uptake water hyacinth was generally tolerant to metallotoxicity except for cu and hg over 80 % of the total amount of metals removed was accumulated in the roots of which 3052 % was adsorbed onto the root surfaces furthermore 7398 % of the total metal assimilation by water hyacinth was located in the roots the bioconcentration factor bcf of cu hg au and zn exceeded the recommended index of 1000 which is used in selection of phytoremediating plants but those of u as and mn did not nevertheless the bcf for mn increased with the increase of mn concentration in water this suggests that the use of bcf index alone without the consideration of plant biomass and metal concentration in water is inadequate to determine the potential of plants for phytoremediation accurately thus this study confirms that water hyacinth holds potential for a broad spectrum of phytoremediation roles however knowing whether these metals are adsorbed on or assimilated within the plant tissues as well as knowing their allocation between roots and shoots will inform decisions how to retreat biomass for metal recovery or the mode of biomass reduction for safe disposal after phytoremediation

backgroundinsomnia is comorbid with internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders however the extent to which the etiologic influences on insomnia and common psychopathology overlap is unclear there are limited genetically informed studies of insomnia and internalizing disorders and few studies of overlap exist with externalizing disorders methodswe utilized twin data from the virginia adult twin studies of psychiatric and substance use disorders total n 7 500 insomnia internalizing disorders major depressive disorder mdd generalized anxiety disorder gad and alcohol abuse or dependence aad were assessed at two time points while antisocial personality disorder aspd was assessed once cholesky decompositions were performed in openmx and longitudinal measurement models were run on available phenotypes to reduce measurement error resultsthe latent additive genetic influences on insomnia overlapped significantly 56% for females 74% for males with mdd and were shared completely 100% with gad there was significant overlap of latent unique environmental influences with overlap ranging from 38 to 100% across disorders in contrast there was less genetic overlap between insomnia and externalizing disorders with 18% of insomnia's heritability shared with aad and 23% with aspd latent unique environmental overlap between insomnia and both externalizing disorders was negligible conclusionsthe evidence for substantial genetic overlap between insomnia and stable aspects of both internalizing disorders suggests that there may be few insomniaspecific genes and investigation into unique environmental factors is important for understanding insomnia development the modest overlap between insomnia and externalizing disorders indicates that these disorders are genetically related but largely etiologically distinct

numerical modelers are often faced with the challenge to numerically reproduce the physical behavior of soilgeosynthetic interaction problems using assumed values for missing soil and interface model parameters this paper examines two such examples using the finitedifference method 1 horizontal pullout of a geosynthetic geogrid reinforcement layer in a pullout box and 2 a geosynthetic geotextile reinforced soil layer over a void it also presents the results of parametric sensitivity analyses for the missing soil and interface model parameter values and identifies the values that give the best agreement with measured data the paper further demonstrates that correct modeling of geometrical nonlinearity is key to accurately predicting the performance of geosyntheticreinforced soil systems controlled by the tensioned membrane effect the lessons learned in this study will be of interest to numerical modelers during numerical model design of geosyntheticreinforced soil systems
operant extinction is learning to supress a previously rewarded behavior it is known to be strongly associated with the specific context in which it was acquired which limits the therapeutic use of operant extinction in behavioral treatments e g of addiction we examined whether sleep influences contextual memory of operant extinction over time using two different recall tests recent and remote rats were trained in an operant conditioning task lever press in context a then underwent extinction training in context b followed by a 3h retention period that contained either spontaneous morning sleep morning sleep deprivation or spontaneous evening wakefulness a recall test was performed either immediately after the 3h experimental retention period recent recall or after 48 h remote in the extinction context b and in a novel context c the two main findings were: i at the recent recall test sleep in comparison with sleep deprivation and spontaneous wakefulness enhanced extinction memory but only in the extinction context b; ii at the remote recall extinction performance after sleep was enhanced in both contexts b and c to an extent comparable to levels at recent recall in context b interestingly extinction performance at remote recall was also improved in the sleep deprivation groups in both contexts with no difference to performance in the sleep group our results suggest that 3 h of postlearning sleep transiently facilitate the context specificity of operant extinction at a recent recall however the improvement and contextual generalization of operant extinction memory observed in the longterm i e after 48 h does not require immediate postlearning sleep

prescribed burning pb is a widespread management technique for wildfire hazard abatement understanding pb effects on tree ecophysiology is key to defining burn prescriptions aimed at reducing fire hazard in mediterranean pine plantations such as pinus pinea l stands we assessed physiological responses of adult p pinea trees to pb using a combination of dendroecological anatomical hydraulic and isotopic analyses treering widths xylem cell wall thickness lumen area hydraulic diameter and tree ring delta c13 and delta o18 were measured in trees on burned and control sites vulnerability curves were elaborated to assess tree hydraulic efficiency or safety despite the relatively intense thermal treatment the residence time of temperatures above 50 degrees c at the stem surface ranged between 242 and 2239 s burned trees did not suffer mechanical damage to stems nor significant reduction in radial growth moreover the pb did not affect xylem structure and tree hydraulics no variations in c13derived water use efficiency were recorded this confirmed the high resistance of p pinea to surface fire at the stem base however burned trees showed consistently lower 6180 values in the pb year as a likely consequence of reduced competition for water and nutrients due to the understory burning which increased both photosynthetic activity and stomatal conductance our multiapproach analysis offers new perspectives on postfire survival strategies of p pinea in an environment where fires are predicted to increase in frequency and severity during the 21st century
there is evidence that some emotional expressions are characterized by diagnostic cues from individual face features for example an upturned mouth is indicative of happiness whereas a furrowed brow is associated with anger the current investigation explored whether motivating people to perceive stimuli in a local ie featurebased rather than global ie holistic processing orientation was advantageous for recognizing emotional facial expressions participants classified emotional faces while primed with local and global processing orientations via a navon letter task contrary to previous findings for identity recognition the current findings are indicative of a modest advantage for face emotion recognition under conditions of local processing orientation when primed with a local processing orientation participants performed both significantly faster and more accurately on an emotion recognition task than when they were primed with a global processing orientation the impacts of this finding for theories of emotion recognition and face processing are considered
amino acids are key components of human and animal nutrition both as part of a proteincontaining diet and as supplemented individual products in the last 10 years there has been a marked move away from the extraction of amino acids from natural products which has been replaced by efficient fermentation processes using nonanimal carbon sources today several amino acids are produced in fermentation plants with capacities of more than 100 000 tonnes to serve the requirements of animal feed and human nutrition the main fermentative amino acids for animal nutrition are llysine lthreonine and ltryptophan dlmethionine continues to be manufactured for animal feed use principally by chemical synthesis and a pharmaceutical grade is manufactured by enzymatic resolution amino acids play an important role in medical nutrition particularly in parenteral nutrition where there are high purity requirements for infusion grade products amino acids are also appearing more often in dietary supplements initially for performance athletes but increasingly for the general population as the understanding of the effects of the individual amino acids on the human metabolism is deepened more specialized product mixtures are being offered to improve athletic performance and for bodybuilding

the noise induced by quantization in digitally controlled systems can be modelled as small amplitude chaotic behaviour described by a simple piecewise linear map the microchaos map the chaotic nature of certain microchaos maps was proved rigorously in the last 20 years it was also pointed out that several disconnected strange attractors or repellers may coexist far from the desired state of the system the control error is influenced by the number of these strange sets and the local behaviour of trajectories in their neighbourhoods in the present paper we focus on the exploration of the possible attractor/repeller structures in the phase space of a pdcontrolled system and estimate the expected control error by several methods
the importance of computer simulations in the assessment of nuclear plant safety systems has increased dramatically during the last three decades the systems of interest include existing or proposed systems that operate for example normal operation in design basis accident conditions and in severe accident scenario beyond the design basis the role of computer simulations is especially critical if one is interested in the reliability robustness or safety of high consequence systems that cannot be physically tested in a fully representative environment in the european 7th framework sarnet project european commission ec cofunded from 2008 to 2013 the phebus fpt3 experiment was chosen as a code benchmark exercise to assess the status of the various codes used for severe accident analyses in light water reactors the aim of the benchmark was to assess the capability of computer codes to model in an integral way the physical processes taking place during a severe accident in a pressurised water reactor pwr starting from the initial stages of core degradation fission product actinide and structural material release their transport through the primary circuit up to the behaviour of the released fission products in the containment the fpt3 benchmark was well supported with participation from 16 organisations in 11 countries using 8 different codes the temperature history of the fuel bundle and the total hydrogen production were well captured no code was able to reproduce accurately the final bundle state using as bulk fuel relocation temperature the temperature of the first significant material relocation observed during the experiment the total volatile fission product release was well simulated but the kinetics were generally overestimated concerning the modelling of semivolatile lowvolatile and structural material release the models need improvement notably for mo and ru for which a substantial difference between bundle and fuel release was experimentally observed due to retention in the cooler upper part of the bundle the retention in the primary circuit was not well predicted this was due mainly the nonprototypic formation of a boronrich blockage in the rising line of the fpt3 steam generator simulated in the circuit as a single external cooled u tube the deposition mechanism and the volatility of some elements te cs i could be better predicted containment vessel thermal hydraulics designed in the experiment to be wellmixed were well calculated concerning the containment aerosol depletion rate only standalone cases in which the input data were derived from experimental data provided acceptable results whilst the integral cases in which the input data came from circuit calculations tended to largely overestimate the total aerosol airborne mass entering the containment the disagreement of the calculated total aerosol airborne mass in the containment vessel with the measured one is due to the combination of a general underestimation of the overall circuit retention and overestimation of fission product and structural material release calculation of iodine chemistry in the containment turned out to be a major challenge its quality strongly depends on the correct prediction of chemistry speciation in the integral codes the major difficulties are related to the presence of high fraction of iodine in gaseous form in the primary circuit during the test which is not correctly reproduced by the codes this inability of the codes compromised simulation of the observed iodine behaviour in the containment in the benchmark a significant user effect was detected different results being obtained by different users of the same code which had to be taken into account in analysing the results this article reports the benchmark results comparing the main parameters calculated and observed summarising the results achieved and identifying the areas in which understanding needs to be improved relevant experimental and theoretical work is under way to resolve the issues raised c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

using 3d technology computer aided design simulation we investigated the impact of equivalent oxide thickness eot on threshold voltage vth variation induced by workfunction variation wfv in multigate devices the wfvinduced vth variation in multigate devices does not significantly vary with the dielectric constant of the gate dielectric material but increases with decreasingphysicaloxide thickness tox as tox becomes thinner electric field tends to be locally concentrated causing a large variation of electrostatic potential in channel the slope of the ratio of average grain size to gate area rgg plot is observed with various oxide thicknesses it is confirmed that we can alleviate the wfvinduced vth variation without significant performance degradation if gate dielectric layer becomes thicker with appropriately adopted higherk engineering in addition the impact of eot including interface layer on the wfvinduced vth variation is studied
this metaanalysis examined the relationship between moral identity and moral behavior it was based on 111 studies from a broad range of academic fields including business developmental psychology and education marketing sociology and sport sciences moral identity was found to be significantly associated with moral behavior random effects model r 22 p < 01 95% ci 19 25 effect sizes did not differ for behavioral outcomes prosocial behavior avoidance of antisocial behavior ethical behavior studies that were entirely based on selfreports yielded larger effect sizes in contrast the smallest effect was found for studies that were based on implicit measures or used priming techniques to elicit moral identity moreover a marginally significant effect of culture indicated that studies conducted in collectivistic cultures yielded lower effect sizes than studies from individualistic cultures overall the metaanalysis provides support for the notion that moral identity strengthens individuals' readiness to engage in prosocial and ethical behavior as well as to abstain from antisocial behavior however moral identity fares no better as a predictor of moral action than other psychological constructs
based on fredrickson's broadenandbuild theory of positive emotion we explored the role of school affect ie positive affect in school and negative affect in school in connecting gratitude prosocial behavior and school satisfaction among a sample of 324 176 males elementary school students in grades 4 to 6 by using structural equation modeling the participants completed a packet of questionnaires including the gratitude questionnaire gq6 the elementary school students' subjective wellbeing in school scale essswbss and the primary school upper grade students' prosocial behaviors questionnaire psugspbq the results showed that elementary school students' 1 positive affect in school and negative affect in school significantly related to school satisfaction; 2 prosocial behavior fully mediated the relation between gratitude and school satisfaction; 3 gratitude related to school satisfaction indirectly through positive affect in school and negative affect in school as hypothesized the effect was stronger for positive affect in school limitations and practical applications of the study were discussed
learning objectives: after participating in this activity learners should be better able to: evaluate the evolution of social cognitive abilities as a developmental process assess the evidence regarding social cognition difficulties in youth at clinical high risk for psychosis individuals at clinical high risk chr for psychosis exhibit a broad range of difficulties including impaired social cognition which may represent a target for early identification and intervention several studies have examined various domains of social cognition in chr individuals most focus on adolescent and young adult populations but given the accumulating evidence that impairment exists before the onset of psychotic disorders it is critically important to begin to look for these risk markers in younger children the present article reviews 25 studies on chr that examine any of the following four domains of social cognition: emotion processing theory of mind social perception or attribution bias eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search conducted using electronic databases including pubmed/medline and psycinfo and combinations of key socialcognition and chr search terms despite some mixed results the existing literature establishes that chr individuals display socialcognitive impairment though it remains unclear as to how and when that impairment develops thus by using the literature on social cognition in typically developing children as a model and reference and by looking at the evolution of socialcognitive abilities as a developmental process our review presents a valuable new perspective that indicates the necessity of further investigation in younger atrisk populations implications for treatment and future research are discussed
cardiomyocytes are prone to variations of the cell cycle such as endoreduplication continuing rounds of dna synthesis without karyokinesis and cytokinesis and acytokinetic mitosis karyokinesis but no cytokinesis such atypical cell cycle variations result in polyploid and multinucleated cells rather than in cell division therefore to determine cardiac turnover and regeneration it is of crucial importance to correctly identify cardiomyocyte nuclei the number of nuclei per cell and their cell cycle status this is especially true for the use of nuclear markers for identifying cell cycle activity such as thymidine analogues ki67 pcna or phh3 here we present methods for recognizing cardiomyocytes and their nuclearity and for determining their cell cycle activity we use two published transgenic systems: the myh6h2bmch transgenic mouse line for the unequivocal identification of cardiomyocyte nuclei and the cagegfpanillin mouse line for distinguishing cell division from cell cycle variations combined together these two systems ease the study of cardiac regeneration and plasticity

research has tried to identify risk factors that increase the likelihood of difficulties with externalizing behavior the relations between individual or environmental factors and externalizing behavior have been especially documented childoriented and parentoriented interventions have been designed in order to decrease externalizing behavior in preschoolers to date however research has largely been compartmentalized it is therefore not known whether childoriented or parentoriented intervention is more effective in reducing externalizing behavior the aim of the current study was to answer this question by comparing two 8week child with two 8week parentoriented group programs sharing a common experimental design this was done in a pseudorandomized trial conducted with 73 36yearold children displaying clinically relevant levels of externalizing behavior who were assigned to one of the four interventions and 20 control participants who were allocated to a waiting list the results indicate that the four programs focusing on a specific target variable ie social cognition inhibition parental selfefficacy beliefs or parental verbal responsiveness are all effective in reducing externalizing behavior among preschoolers their effectiveness was moderated neither by their orientation toward the child or the parent nor by their content suggesting that several effective solutions exist to improve behavioral adaptation in preschoolers a second important highlight of this study is that thanks to comparable effect sizes brief focused programs appear to be a reasonable alternative to long multimodal programs and may be more costeffective for children and their families

a methodology for predicting scaling in membrane distillation md which considers thermodynamics kinetics and fluid mechanics is developed and experimentally validated with calcium sulfate the theory predicts the incidence of scaling as a function of temperature concentration and flow conditions by comparing the nucleation induction time to the residence time and applying an experimental correction factor the relevant residence time is identified by considering a volume of solution near the membrane surface that contains enough ions to form a nucleus of critical size the theory is validated with fouling experiments using calcium sulfate as a model sealant over a range of temperatures 4070 degrees c saturation indices and flow rates although the model is validated with a benchscale md system it is hoped to be compatible with largescale systems that may have significant changes in concentration temperature and flow rate along the flow direction at lower temperatures the saturation index can be as high as 0405 without scaling but the safe concentration limit decreases with increasing temperature increasing the feed flow rate reduces concentration polarization and fluid residence time both of which decrease the likelihood of fouling the model is translated into easily readable maps outlining safe operating regimes for md the theory and maps can be used to choose safe operating conditions in md over a wide range of conditions and system geometries

the concept of energy is widely employed in introductory science courses however the term energy is defined and utilized in different ways depending on the context even within a given discipline through the lens of metaphor theory these various definitions of energy are seen as metaphors that highlight and obscure characteristics of energy working under this framework undergraduate students in introductory biology chemistry and physics courses were asked to write analogies that reflect their understanding of the role of energy in the context of ecosystems n49 chemical reactions n36 mechanical systems n65 and electrical circuits n44 these analogies were analyzed qualitatively using metaphor theory to gain understanding of how students conceptualize energy in these different contexts the results of this study indicate that students use seven different conceptual metaphors to explain the role of energy in various scientific contexts: energy as a substance that can be accounted for energy as a substance that can flow can change forms can be carried can be lost can be an ingredient or a product and energy as a process or interaction this result gives teachers a framework to use in evaluating student ideas about energy
neural progenitor cells have a central role in the development and evolution of the vertebrate brain during early brain development neural progenitors first expand their numbers through repeated proliferative divisions and then begin to exhibit neurogenic divisions the transparent and experimentally accessible optic tectum of xenopus laevis is an excellent model system for the study of the cell biology of neurogenesis but the precise spatial and temporal relationship between proliferative and neurogenic progenitors has not been explored in this system here we construct a spatial map of proliferative and neurogenic divisions through lineage tracing of individual progenitors and their progeny we find a clear spatial separation of proliferative and neurogenic progenitors along the anteriorposterior axis of the optic tectum with proliferative progenitors located more posteriorly and neurogenic progenitors located more anteriorly since individual progenitors are repositioned toward more anterior locations as they mature this spatial separation likely reflects an increasing restriction in the proliferative potential of individual progenitors we then examined whether the transition from proliferative to neurogenic behavior correlates with cellular properties that have previously been implicated in regulating neurogenesis onset our data reveal that the transition from proliferation to neurogenesis is associated with a small change in cleavage plane orientation and a more pronounced change in cell cycle kinetics in a manner reminiscent of observations from mammalian systems our findings highlight the potential to use the optic tectum of xenopus laevis as an accessible system for the study of the cell biology of neurogenesis c 2016 wiley periodicals inc
heterogeneous computing combining devices with different architectures such as cpus and gpus is rising in popularity and promises increased performance combined with reduced energy consumption opencl has been proposed as a standard for programming such systems and offers functional portability however it suffers from poor performance portability because applications must be retuned for every new device in this paper we use machine learningbased autotuning to address this problem benchmarks are run on a random subset of the tuning parameter spaces and the results are used to build a machine learningbased performance model the model can then be used to find interesting subspaces for further search we evaluate our method using five image processing benchmarks with tuning parameter space sizes up to 23 m using different input sizes on several devices including an intel i7 4771 haswell cpu an nvidia tesla k40 gpu and an amd radeon hd 7970 gpu we compare different machine learning algorithms for the performance model our model achieves a mean relative error as low as 38% and is able to find solutions on average only 029% slower than the best configuration in some cases evaluating less than 11% of the search space the source code of our framework is available at https://githubcom/acelster/mlautotuning

nonverbal communication using social cues like gestures governs a great part of our daily interactions it has been proposed that people with autism spectrum disorder asd show a deviant processing of social cues throughout their social cognitive development however social cues do not always convey an intention to communicate hence the aim of this study was to test the sensitivity of adolescents and adults with asd and neurotypical controls to social cues of high communicative pointing and low communicative values grasping for this purpose we employed a spatial cueing paradigm with both cue types and compared saccadic reaction times srts between conditions in which the target appeared at a location which was congruent versus incongruent with the direction of the cue results showed that both adolescents and adults with asd had slower srts for the incongruent relative to the congruent condition for both cue types reflecting sensitivity to these cues additionally mental effort during the processing of these social cues was assessed by means of pupil dilation this analysis revealed that while individuals with and without asd required more mental effort to process incongruent compared to the congruent cues cues with higher communicative value posed more processing load for the asd group these findings suggest that the perception of social gestures is intact in asd but requires additional mental effort for gestures with higher communicative value

while most commercially available functional nearinfrared spectroscopy fnirs systems employ optical fibers for both the measurement optode and the transmission cable for optical signals their material inflexibility presents some problems in stable optode fixation to the head surface and adequate cable lining to the main system in practice mechanical fluctuations of optical fibers in fnirs measurement often lead to motion artifacts in the signals a few fiberless fnirs systems are available and equipped with light sources and detectors that directly adhere to the scalp surface however their shapes and detection sensitivities are not suitable for usage on a haircovered head based on the commercial fiberless fnirs system oeg16 spectratech inc japan we developed a new sourcedetector unit that was designed with leds for enhanced illumination avalanche photodiodes instead of photodiodes and a new holder system the electrical circuits of the system were modified after the design by simultaneous implementation of multidistance fnirs measurement and hemodynamic modality separation on conventional fnirs data at the bilateral parietal area during singlesided motor tasks significant functional signals were observed only at the position contralateral to the side of movement this is the first report describing a fiberless fnirs system that can detect functional signals on a haircovered head we believe this fiberless system will improve the utility of fnirs particularly in less restraining conditions

cloud computing has recently emerged as a dominant internet service computing model due to its payasyougo and elastic service features cloud computing systems are usually composed of distributed datacenters which leverage virtualization technology to provide a scalable and reliable service optical networks are recognized as promising nextgeneration core networks for connecting these distributed datacenters due to their characteristics such as high bandwidth provisioning low latency low bit error rate etc however concern about the everincreasing energy consumption of cloud computing systems together with core networks has been raised due to high electricity bills as well as environmental pollution in this paper we study the energyaware provisioning in optical cloud networks epocn problem for both dynamic and static cases when traffic requests arrive in an online fashion we propose a polynomialtime energyaware routing algorithm to solve the dynamic epocn problem simulations show that our energyaware routing algorithm brings more energy savings in comparison to a shortest pathbased routing algorithm and a traffic grooming algorithm on the other hand we show that the epocn problem in the static case the traffic matrix is known in advance is nphard we further divide this problem into 1 the energyaware routing ear problem in optical networks and 2 the energyefficient server and switch allocation essa problem in datacenter networks considering these two sub problems are still nphard we present an exact integer linear program ilp and a heuristic to solve each problem we also conduct simulations to compare the proposed ilps and heuristics in terms of energy consumption and running time c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved
after a coal mining accident the key to the success of the coal mining emergency rescue is that the trapped miners are still alive before the rescue passage are made through as new lifesaving equipment lifesaving foods are used to maintain the viability and the selfsaving ability of the frontline miners when they are trapped in the coal mining accident the lifesaving food will effectively extend the selfsave time for the trapped miners and then essentially improve the rescued possibility of the trapped miners the amount of human metabolism which was measured under the hot and humid environment determines salt targets and nutrition indexes of the lifesaving food according to the particularity of underground environment the passage explores the method to store the lifesaving food and how to reasonably select the storage locations reviewing the application of the mine lifesaving food we can conclude that the selfsaving food will have a better future in the economic and social aspects but it still needs to be demonstrated whether it is necessary to carry the food with the human body when the lifesaving food is exposed under the hot and humid environment the deterioration cure is still unclear
in this study the effect of urbanization and environmental pollution on qualitative structural and quantitative changes of the corylus avellana hazel pollen was investigated using scanning electron microscopy fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and curvefitting analysis of amide i profile the obtained spectroscopic results show significant variations in the fraction of proteins in the hazel pollen which probably depend on various degrees of anthropopression our results suggest that alterations in the chemical composition of pollen induced by urbanization and air pollutants may intensify the allergenic potential and may cause the increase in the incidence of allergies in people mutations in nucleic acids are accompanied by a number of molecular changes leading to the formation of allergenic proteins it seems that the type of habitat where the pollen grew affects the individual differentiation indeed it was found that in the site exhibiting low pollution the hazel pollen contain a lower amount of proteins than to the ones from a site with high anthropopression hence ftir spectroscopy and curvefitting analysis of amide i profile can be successfully applied as tools for identifying quantitative and qualitative changes of proteins in hazel pollen anthropogenic factors such as air pollution and urbanization lead to changes in structure and chemical composition of hazel pollen fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and gaussian analysis showed structural changes in hazel pollen collected from sites with different absorbance values of individual chemical functional groups and changes in the secondary structure of proteins of the pollen graphics

as the most fascinating complex and dynamic part of our organism the human brain is shaped by many interacting factors that not only are of neurobiological including sex hormones and environmental origin but are also sociocultural in their very nature such as social roles gender is one of these factors most neurological neurodevelopmental neuropsychiatric and psychosomatic disorders are characterized by impairments in visual social cognition primarily body language reading and face perception and a skewed sex ratio: females and males are affected differently in terms of clinical picture prevalence and severity is the social brain sex specific? this is still an open question for a long time and for many reasons sex differences have been overlooked or entirely ignored in neuroscience and biomedical research: there is a paucity of neuroimaging work examining sex differences in the social brain however the pattern of experimental behavioral data in both healthy typically developing individuals and patients with deficient social cognition is beyond simple interpretation: contrary to popular wisdom females are not always more proficient in understanding social signals and their social abilities may be particularly affected by disease clarification of how neurobiological sex and sociocultural gender affect the social brain would provide novel insights into understanding genderspecific vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders this interaction is far beyond simplicity although sex differences represent a rather delicate topic underestimation or exaggeration of possible effects retards progress in the field c 2016 wiley periodicals inc

locationaware services las are special contextaware services that recommend suitable services to a user based on the user's location however considerable uncertainty exists when detecting a user's location previous studies have rarely discussed such uncertainty or emphasized the timeliness and efficiency of such systems therefore a fuzzy collaborative problem solving strategy was used to enhance the performance of a ubiquitous las system measured according to the timeliness of a service and the efficiency of the recommendation process the uncertainty of detecting a user's location using gps is first considered by modeling the location and speed of the user with fuzzy numbers after considering these uncertain parameters a fuzzy mixedinteger programming problem is formulated to determine the timely service location and path for each user however the fuzzy mixedinteger programming problem is not easy to solve therefore a fuzzy collaborative problem solving strategy is used to decompose the fuzzy mixedinteger programming problem into smaller pieces that can be handled by separate processing modules the most favorable path to a user also leads the user to a region with multiple service locations instead of a single service to maximize total timeliness to elaborate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology an experiment was conducted in downtown taichung city taiwan based on the experimental results the proposed methodology was able to be used to determine a timely service location for a specific user as revealed by the reduced average waiting time the proposed methodology also reduced the time necessary to find a timely location and path which contributed to its enhanced efficiency c 2015 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

among anxious populations attention has been demonstrated to be preferentially biased to threatening material compared to neutral or other valenced material individuals who have high levels of trait worry such as those with generalized anxiety disorder gad may be biased to threat but research has produced equivocal findings this review aimed to systematically review the extant experimental literature to establish the current evidence of attentional bias to threat among trait worriers compared to healthy controls and other clinical populations twentynine published articles were included in the final review there was strong evidence of a bias to threat among gad patients compared to other groups and this was found across most experimental paradigms few studies had investigated this bias in nonclinical trait worriers among gad patients this bias to threat was most strongly evidenced when visual threat material was in a verballinguistic format ie words rather than when in pictorial form ie images or faces the bias was also found across several domains of negative material supporting the general nature of worry further research should look to examine the specific components of the threat bias in gad as well as investigating the bias to threat in trait worriers
for modern automatic test equipment it is not unusual to have multiple computers making up a single system one issue with having multiple computers is the requirement for each computer to have a disk drive and associated operating system this becomes an issue in environments that require periods processing as each system must be cleared prior to moving from one operating state to another this process can become even more complicated by the fact that some of the computers may be installed in places that are not readily accessible for quick turnaround in addition these computers require additional disk drives to support the operation in each mode in order to reduce the complexity of periods processing a scheme of diskless operation can be used to allow multiple computers to share a single disk drive off a master computer this paper will describe a method to handle just such a complex scenario in this particular instance several computers are hosted running multiple operating systems off of one main computer's hard drive this allows for quick and reliable periods processing to be performed while maintaining acceptable performance with the advent of cheap solid state disk drives and fast intelligent managed switches the performance of the overall system is actually not impacted much at all modern operating systems and tools provide the capability to implement diskless nodes in a fairly straightforward manner while this technology is not new by any means older ate used sun computers in a diskless configuration modern technology makes this easy to implement and provides a performance close enough to a disk based system to be an effective solution in addition by removing the extra disks not only is the periods processing time reduced but the margin of error in completing the conversion is reduced to the one drive
classifying 3d measurement data has become a core problem in photogrammetry and 3d computer vision since the rise of modern multiview geometry techniques combined with affordable range sensors we introduce a markov random fieldbased approach for segmenting textured meshes generated via multiview stereo into urban classes of interest the input mesh is first partitioned into small clusters referred to as superfacets from which geometric and photometric features are computed a random forest is then trained to predict the class of each superfacet as well as its similarity with the neighboring superfacets similarity is used to assign the weights of the markov random field pairwisepotential and to account for contextual information between the classes the experimental results illustrate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed framework c 2016 published by elsevier bv on behalf of international society for photogrammetry and remote sensing inc isprs
based on the qualitative research of elite interviews and narrative analysis of hungarian documents the main aim of this article is twofold: 1 to elucidate the transformation of jobbik from a marginal extraparliamentary youth focused movement to an influential parliamentary party; 2 to discuss the impact of jobbik's ascension on the main centre right fidesz only as a preconclusion it argues that the rise of jobbik is not a protest phenomenon that simply demonstrates a social disenchantment with the transitional economy jobbik's transformation is a unique postcommunist political development that is rooted in elements of hungarian nationalism these national elements include underlying social prejudice against roma and jews a preference for paternalistic economic systems and even attraction to the historical narrative of mythic turanism in the debate over the origins of hungarian national identity jobbik manipulates all of these national elements for the transformation of its own party identity emerging as a main challenger to the fidesz c 2016 published by elsevier ltd on behalf of the regents of the university of california

from an ecological perspective the nature of rainwater harvesting with the characteristics of artificial disturbance is a manual disturbance so it is very important to confirm the degree of ecological disturbance that occurs due to rainwater harvesting drawing from ecological disturbance theory we can utilize both the distance method and dynamic curve method to estimate the level of ecological disturbance and degree of rainwater harvesting with a historical reference point value of the environment as a frame of reference and with the 20 indicators such as surface runoff and evaluation index our examples show that the distance method and dynamic curve method are feasible for evaluating the ecological disturbance degree of rainwater harvesting there are also researchscale effects in the study of ecological disturbance of rainwater harvesting that embody the comparability of different spatial and temporal ecological disturbance degrees the comparability of ecological disturbance degrees of rainwater harvesting in an area at different scales or in different areas at the same scales is not strong but it also generates some useful reference values the ecological disturbance measurement in the same study area and at the same researchscale at different historical periods can be compared
purpose inverting electroheat problems involves synthesizing the electromagnetic arrangement of coils and geometries to realize a desired heat distribution to this end two finite element problems need to be solved first for the magnetic fields and the joule heat that the associated eddy currents generate and then based on these heat sources the second problem for heat distribution this twopart problem needs to be iterated on to obtain the desired thermal distribution by optimization being a time consuming process the purpose of this paper is to parallelize the process using the graphics processing unit gpu and the realcoded genetic algorithm each for both speed and accuracy design/methodology/approach this coupled problem represents a heavy computational load with long waittimes for results the gpu has recently been demonstrated to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the finite element computations and cut down solution times it has also been used to speedup the naturally parallel genetic algorithm the authors use the gpu to perform coupled electroheat finite element optimization by the genetic algorithm to achieve computational efficiencies far better than those reported for a single finite element problem in the genetic algorithm coding objective functions in real numbers rather than binary arithmetic gives added speed and accuracy findings the feasibility of the method proposed to reduce computational time and increase accuracy is established through the simple problem of shaping a current carrying conductor so as to yield a constant temperature along a line the authors obtained a speedup cpu time to gpu time ratio saturating to about 28 at a population size of 500 because of increasing communications between threads but this far better than what is possible on a workstation research limitations/implications by using the intrinsically parallel genetic algorithm on a gpu large complex coupled problems may be solved very quickly the method demonstrated here without accounting for radiation and convection may be trivially extended to more completely modeled electroheat systems since the primary purpose here is to establish methodology and feasibility the thermal problem is simplified by neglecting convection and radiation while that introduces some error the computational procedure is still validated practical implications the methodology established has direct applications in electrical machine design metallurgical mixing processes and hyperthermia treatment in oncology in these three practical application areas the authors need to compute the exciting coil or antenna arrangement current magnitude and phase and device geometry that would accomplish a desired heat distribution to achieve mixing reduce machine heat or burn cancerous tissue this process presented does it more accurately and speedily social implications particularly the abovementioned application in oncology will alleviate human suffering through use in hyperthermia treatment planning in cancer treatment the method presented provides scope for new commercial software development and employment originality/value previous finite element shape optimization of coupled electroheat problems by this group used gradient methods whose difficulties are explained others have used analytical and circuit models in place of finite elements this paper applies the massive parallelization possible with gpus to the inherently parallel genetic algorithm and extends it from single field system problems to coupled problems and thereby realizes practicable solution times for such a computationally complex problem further by using gpu computations rather than cpu accuracy is enhanced and then by using real number rather than binary coding for object functions further accuracy and speed gains are realized
under the design conditions of a research reactor the siphon phenomenon induced by pipe rupture can cause continuous efflux of water in order to prevent water efflux an additional facility is necessary a siphon breaker is a type of safety facility that can resist the loss of coolant effectively however analysis of siphon breaking is complex since it comprises twophase flow and there are many inputs to be considered for this reason in order to facilitate the analysis and design of the siphon breaker a simulation program based on fluid mechanics was developed using mfc microsoft foundation class programming from bernoulli's equation the velocity and quantity as well as undershooting height water level pressure friction coefficient and factors related to the twophase flow could be calculated the chisholm model which was included in the program to analyze the twophase flow can predict the results in a manner similar to those obtained from a realscale experiment by modifying the values of the input parameters and analyzing the results with respect to loss of coolant accident loca locations the size of pipe and coefficients could be compared easily since simulation results are shown in the form of a graph the user is able to confirm the total breaking situation furthermore it is possible to save the entire simulation results the simulation results were shown to be similar to those obtained from the realscale experiment and the program functioned correctly by using the program the user is easily able to confirm the status of the siphon breaking and the program is also helpful in the design of the siphon breaker c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
an experimental program of largescale direct shear tests has indicated that shear displacement of a gravel drainage layer and nonwoven geotextile protection layer over a highdensity polyethylene hdpe geomembrane under moderate to high normal stress conditions can cause much greater damage to the geomembrane than static pressure alone essentially no damage was observed at low normal stress the greatest damage occurred at high normal stress 1 389 kpa using a lightweight geotextile 335 g/m 2 and yielded an average of 31 holes/m 2 with a maximum hole size of 29 mm surprisingly geomembrane damage measured using a lightweight geotextile was greater than that measured using no geotextile due to a change in failure surface location for the same conditions shearinduced damage was slightly less for a geomembrane placed on a compacted sand subgrade than on a compacted clay subgrade interface shear strength increased significantly with decreasing geotextile mass/area due to greater outofplane deformation of the geomembrane the findings suggest that the placement of a gravel drainage layer on top of a hdpe geomembrane even with a protection nonwoven geotextile should be viewed with caution for landfill bottom liner systems and other moderateto highstress applications if there is a reasonable expectation for interface shear displacement projectspecific direct shear tests should be conducted to determine the potential for shearinduced geomembrane damage recommendations are provided for the performance of such tests and for design options when damage mitigation is necessary c 2014 american society of civil engineers
the goal of ratio enhancement for hyperspectral hs image pansharpening is to obtain an enhancement ratio between a simulated lowresolution panchromatic pan image and an original highresolution pan image however the simulated lowresolution pan image often suffers from graylevel distortion to solve these problems the original hs bands are synthesized to a smaller number of reduced hs bands then the pixels of pan and hs images are divided into different groups according to the linearity between the pan band and the reduced bands for each pixel group a nonnegative leastsquares algorithm is utilized to calculate the weights of reduced hs bands so that the simulated pan image is obtained by weighted summation of reduced hs bands finally the hs image is sharpened by a ratio enhancement the experiments demonstrated that the proposed method had a good performance on fusion quality c 2017 society of photooptical instrumentation engineers spie

flow cytometry has contributed to virology but has faced many drawbacks concerning detection limits due to the small size of viral particles nonetheless giant viruses changed many concepts in the world of viruses as a result of their size and hence opened up the possibility of using flow cytometry to study them recently we developed a high throughput isolation of viruses using flow cytometry and protozoa coculture consequently isolating a viral mixture in the same sample became more common nevertheless when one virus multiplies faster than others in the mixture it is impossible to obtain a pure culture of the minority population here we describe a robust sorting system which can separate viable giant virus mixtures from supernatants we tested three flow cytometry sorters by sorting artificial mixtures purity control was assessed by electron microscopy and molecular biology as proof of concept we applied the sorting system to a coculture supernatant taken from a sample containing a viral mixture that we couldn't separate using end point dilution in addition to isolating the quickgrowing mimivirus we sorted and recultured a new slowgrowing virus which we named cedratvirus the sorting assay presented in this paper is a powerful and versatile tool for separating viral populations from amoeba cocultures and adding value to the new field of flow virometry
the screening of a number of chiral stationary phases csps with different modifiers in supercritical fluid chromatography to find a chromatographic method for separation of enantiomers can be timeconsuming computational methods for data analysis were utilized to establish a hierarchical screening strategy using a dataset of 110 druglike chiral compounds with diverse structures tested on 15 csps with two different modifiers this dataset was analyzed using a combinatorial algorithm principal component analysis pca and a correlation matrix the primary goal was to find a set of eight columns resolving a large number of compounds but also having complementary enantioselective properties in addition to the hereby defined hierarchical experimental strategy quantitative structure enantioselective models qsers were evaluated the diverse chemical space and relatively limited size of the training set reduced the accuracy of the qsers however including separation factors from other csps increased the accuracies of the qsers substantially hence such combined models can support the experimental strategy in prioritizing the csps of the second screening phase when a compound is not separated by the primary set of columns

whether theory of mind tom is preserved in alzheimer's disease ad remains a controversial subject recent studies have showed that performance on some tom tests might be altered in ad though to a lesser extent than in behaviouralvariant frontotemporal dementia bvftd it is however unclear if this reflects a genuine impairment of tom or a deficit secondary to the general cognitive decline observed in ad aiming to investigate the cognitive determinants of tom performance in ad a datamining study was conducted in 29 ad patients then replicated in an independent agematched group of 19 ad patients to perform an independent replication of the results 44 bvftd patients were included as a comparison group all patients had an extensive neuropsychological examination hierarchical clustering analyses showed that tom performance clustered with measures of executive functioning ef in ad tom performance was also specifically correlated with the executive component extracted from a principal component analysis in a final step automated linear modelling conducted to determine the predictors of tom performance showed that 488% of tom performance was significantly predicted by executive measures similar findings across analyses were observed in the independent group of ad patients thereby replicating our results conversely tom impairments in bvftd appeared independent of other cognitive impairments these results suggest that difficulties of ad patients on tom tests do not reflect a genuine tom deficit rather mediated by general and particularly executive cognitive decline they also suggest that ef has a key role in mental state attribution which support interacting models of tom functioning finally our study highlights the relevancy of datamining statistical approaches in clinical and cognitive neurosciences c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

whether people seek help depends on their estimations of both the likelihood and the value of getting it although past research has carefully examined how accurately helpseekers predict whether their help requests will be granted it has failed to examine how accurately helpseekers predict the value of that help should they receive it in this paper we focus on how accurately helpseekers predict a key determinant of help value namely helper effort in four studies we find that a helpers put more effort into helping than helpseekers expect studies 14 ; b people do not underestimate the effort others will expend in general but rather only the effort others will expend helping them study 2 ; and c this underestimation of help effort stems from helpseekers' failure to appreciate the discomfort in particular the guilt that helpers would experience if they did not do enough to help studies 3 & 4 c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma icc is an aggressive malignancy associated with unfavorable prognosis and for which no effective treatments are available its molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood genomewide sequencing and highthroughput technologies have provided critical insights into the molecular basis of icc while sparking a heated debate on the cellular origin cancer exhibits variabilities in origin progression and cell biology recent evidence suggests that icc has multiple cellular origins including differentiated hepatocytes; intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells ibecs /cholangiocytes; pluripotent stem cells such as hepatic stem/progenitor cells hpcs and biliary tree stem/progenitor cells btscs ; and peribiliary gland pbg however both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are highly cell typespecific multiple cellular origins may have profoundly different genomic landscapes and key signaling pathways driving phenotypic variation and thereby posing significant challenges to personalized medicine in terms of achieving the optimal drug response and patient outcome considering this information we have summarized the latest experimental evidence and relevant literature to provide an uptodate view of the cellular origin of icc which will contribute to establishment of a hierarchical model of carcinogenesis and allow for improvement of the anatomicalbased classification of icc these new insights have important implications for both the diagnosis and treatment of icc patients c 2016 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved

switched systems theory is used to analyze the stability of imagebased observers for threedimensional localization of objects in a scene in the presence of intermittent measurements due to occlusions feature tracking losses or a limited camera field of view for example generally observers or filters that are exponentially stable under persistent measurement availability may have unbounded error growth under intermittent measurement loss even while providing seemingly accurate state estimates by constructing a framework that utilizes a state predictor during periods when measurements are not available a class of imagebased observers is shown to be exponentially convergent in the presence of intermittent measurements if an average dwell time and a total unmeasurability time condition is satisfied the conditions are developed in a general form applicable to any observer that is exponentially convergent assuming persistent visibility and utilizes object motion knowledge to reduce the amount of time measurements must be available to maintain convergence guarantees based on the stability results simulations are provided to show improved performance compared to a zeroorder hold approach where state estimates are held constant when measurements are not available experimental results are also included to verify the theoretical results to demonstrate applicability of the developed observer and predictor design and to compare against a typical approach using an extended kalman filter
information security can be achieved using cryptography steganography or a combination of them where data is firstly encrypted using any of the available cryptography techniques and then hid into any hiding medium recently the famous genomic dna has been introduced as a hiding medium known as dna steganography due to its notable ability to hide huge data sets with a high level of randomness and hence security despite the numerous cryptography techniques to our knowledge only the vigenere cipher and the dnabased playfair cipher have been combined with the dna steganography which keeps space for investigation of other techniques and coming up with new improvements this paper presents a comprehensive analysis between the dnabased playfair vigenere rsa and the aes ciphers each combined with a dna hiding technique the conducted analysis reports the performance diversity of each combined technique in terms of security speed hiding capacity in addition to both key size and data size moreover this paper proposes a modification of the current combined dnabased playfair cipher technique which makes it not only simple and fast but also provides a significantly higher hiding capacity and security the conducted extensive experimental studies confirm such outstanding performance in comparison with all the discussed combined techniques c 2016 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
humans can detect whether athletes are leading or trailing based on thin slices of athletes' nonverbal behavior presumably because communicating and interpreting status has evolved to be highly beneficial for humans the goal of the present research was to examine this evolutionary perspective on nonverbal behavior in sports first in experiment 1 n 40 we investigated if leading athletes are rated higher on dimensions related to social status than are trailing athletes experiment 1 showed that perceivers rated leading athletes as more dominant more proud and more confident than trailing athletes without being aware of the actual score second we were interested in the role of headrelated versus bodyrelated information and in the role of dynamic versus static information in experiment 2 120 participants watched short videos from basketball matches and rated whether athletes were leading or trailing we occluded either athletes' faces athletes' bodies or showed both faces and bodies experiments 2 and 3 n 160 showed that very scarce information was sufficient for differentiating between leading and trailing athletes even when faces or bodies were occluded these findings are in line with ecological approaches to person perception and evolutionary accounts of nonverbal behavior
heroes are ubiquitous in literature and popular discourse yet little is known about cognitive representations of heroes we examined lay conceptions of heroes using a prototype approach compared heroes with other persons of influence and studied how individuals use hero features to identify heroes in study 1 participants n 189 generated openended descriptions of heroes which were sorted by independent coders into 26 meaningful categories in study 2 participants n 365 rated the centrality of these features and subsequently classified each feature as either central eg brave moral integrity or peripheral eg humble proactive in a reaction time rt paradigm participants in study 3 n 33 identified central features of heroes faster than peripheral features in study 4 participants n 25 remembered more central hero features than peripheral features in a surprise recall task in study 5 n 89 participants most strongly identified a hero when the target was described with central features vs peripheral or neutral features in studies 6 n 212 and 7 n 307 participants' ratings evidenced that the prototypical features of heroes did not fit conceptually as well for role models and leaders in all these studies contribute new ideas to existing knowledge about heroes and contribute to a shared understanding of what a hero means to people our research is thus an important step in refining heroism into a scientific concept the notion of the prototypical features of heroes provides a basis for future hero research and intervention
apoptosis is required to maintain tissue homeostasis in multicellular organisms platelets the anucleate cells that are essential for blood clotting are a prime example their brief life span in the circulation is regulated by the intrinsic apoptosis pathway prosurvival bclxl also termed bcl2l1 is essential for platelet viability it functions to restrain the proapoptotic bcl2 family members bak also termed bak1 and bax the essential mediators of intrinsic apoptosis genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of bclxl results in thrombocytopenia conversely deletion of bak in platelets doubles their circulating life span however what triggers platelet apoptosis in vivo remains unclear the proapoptotic bh3only proteins are essential for initiating apoptosis in nucleated cells and there is some evidence to suggest they also play a role in platelet biology we investigated whether puma also termed bbc3 a potent bh3only protein that can inhibit all prosurvival bcl2 family members as well as directly activate bax regulates the death of platelets surprisingly loss of puma had no impact on the loss of platelets caused by loss of bclxl it therefore remains to be established whether other bh3only proteins play a critical role in induction of apoptosis in platelets or whether their death is controlled solely by the interactions between bclxl with bak and bax
over past two decades there has been significant improvement in medical field in elucidating the underlying pathophysiology and genetics of addison's disease adrenal insufficiency addison's disease is a rare disease with an incidence of 08/100 000 cases the diagnosis may be delayed if the clinical presentation mimics a gastrointestinal disorder or psychiatric illness we report a case of addison's disease presenting as acute pain in abdomen mimicking clinical presentation of acute pancreatitis
in recent years significant attention has been given to renewable energy integration within the context of global climate change in the meantime the energywater nexus literature has recognized that the electricity & water infrastructure that enables the production distribution and consumption of these two precious commodities is intertwined while these two issues may seem unrelated their resolution is potentially synergistic in that renewable energy technologies not only present low co2 emissions but also low waterintensities as well therefore renewable energy integration has the potential to address both sustainability concerns and yet renewable energy integration studies have yet to methodologically consider an integrated energywater infrastructure many of these works rely on a coupled unit commitmenteconomic dispatch simulation recently a simultaneous cooptimization method has been contributed for the economic dispatch of networks that include water power and coproduction facilities this paper builds upon this foundation with the development of the corresponding unit commitment problem it demonstrates the optimization on several case studies inspired by singapore & the middle east it concludes that renewable energy simultaneously reduces co2 emissions and water withdrawals furthermore it shows how water storage can help alleviate binding coproduction constraints flatten production profiles and reduce production cost levels c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
in the last quarter of the twentieth century a new class of materials geosynthetics emerged prospectively leading significant innovation in the design of geotechnical and geoenvironmental systems geotextiles have proven to be among the most versatile and technoeconomically viable ground modification materials playing a significant role in modern pavement design and maintenance techniques with the growing environmental concern across the globe technologists researchers have inclined towards the natural geotextile where jute geotextile jgt is one of the potential candidates but jgt has been restricted mainly as underlay in road construction hence there is an urgent need to design and develop a precise innovative fabric as overlay on existing pavements and other emerging civil works to stay technically and economically competitive in the global market such a fabric will not only prove technoeconomically viable but will also reduce the carbon footprint generation to a large extent this paper delineates the development of grey jute paving fabric gjpf followed by its bituminization with suitable type and grade of bitumen to develop bituminized jute paving fabric bjpf the bjpf will enhance the life of the overlay thereby reducing the cost of maintenance as well as serving as a partial substitute of bitumen mastic
while female participation in work places has increased over the last decades women only make up 12 % of the 125 million seafarers worldwide the international maritime organization imo and the international labor organizations are making a concerted effort to promote women into the maritime industry still there are barriers in the maritime industry that hinder female employment particularly in leadership positions the primary aim of the paper is to investigate whether there is a significant difference in implicit beliefs about leadership between males and females in addition to this it seeks to evaluate whether the aforementioned difference is within the context of masculine versus neutral work domains the findings indicated that employees in the maritime industry might have lower expectations towards female leaders thereby indicating the presence of gender bias in the evaluation of leaders

our group recently developed a novel covered carotid stent that can prevent emboli while preserving the external carotid artery eca branch blood flow however our recent in vitro sidebranch eca flow preservation tests on the covered stents revealed the need for further stent frame design improvements including the consideration to crimp the stent to a low profile for the delivery of the stent system and having bigger cells hence the current work aims to design new bare metal stents with bigger cell size to improve the crimpability and to accommodate more slits so that the sidebranch flow could be further increased three new stent designs were analyzed using finite element analysis and benchmarked against two commercially available carotid stents in terms of their mechanical performances such as crimpability radial strength and flexibility results indicated that the new bare metal stent designs matched well against the commercial stents hence our new generation covered stents based on these designs can be expected to perform better in sidebranch flow preservation without compromising on their mechanical performances
the authors report preliminary findings on the potential contribution of cyp2c19 isoenzyme to the human metabolism of ndesmethylclobazam nclb the main active metabolite of clobazam clb a benzodiazepine frequently used as addon therapy in patients with refractory epilepsy two children on clb treatment showing extremely high plasma concentration/dose ratio c/d of nclb and metabolite/parent drug ratio nclb/clb suggestive of a putative poor metabolizer pm phenotype were tested for cyp2ci9 polymorphisms eleven epileptic patients on stable clb therapy were included for reference values of clb and nclb metabolic variables and tested for possible cyp2ci9 polymorphisms detection of the cyp2c19*2 cyp2c19*3 and cyp2c19*4 mutations was performed in the genomic dna by pcr amplification and enzyme digestion procedures in the two presumed cyp2c19 pm patients the nclb/clb ratio was 10 to 27fold higher than matched median values of the control epileptic patients according to cyp2c19 genotyping one patient was homozygous for cyp2c19*2 while the second presented only one copy of the same mutation a genotype also found in three control patients these observations provide further indirect in vivo evidence of cyp2ci9 isoenzyme involvement in the metabolism of the clb main metabolite according to genotyping subjects carrying one or two copies of the defective cyp2c19*2 allele might develop markedly elevated steadystate plasma concentrations of nclb and be at higher risk of adverse effects
background: designing evidencebased interventions to address socioeconomic disparities in health and health behaviours requires a better understanding of the specific explanatory mechanisms we aimed to investigate a comprehensive range of potential theoretical mediators of physical activity pa and screen time in different socioeconomic status ses groups: a high ses group of high school students and a low ses group of vocational school students the comb system including the theoretical domains framework tdf was used as a heuristic framework to synthesise different theoretical determinants in this exploratory study methods: finnish vocational and high school students n 659 aged 1619 responded to a survey assessing psychological social and environmental determinants of activity pa and screen time these determinants are mappable into the comb domains: capability opportunity and motivation the outcome measures were validated selfreport measures for pa and screen time the statistical analyses included a bootstrappingbased mediation procedure results: regarding pa there were ses differences in all of the comb domains for example vocational school students reported using less selfmonitoring of pa weaker injunctive norms to engage in regular pa and fewer intentions than high school students mediation analyses identified potential mediators of the sespa relationship in all of three domains: the most important candidates included selfmonitoring ci95 for b: 019047 identity 004025 and material resources available 001016 however ses was not related to most determinants of screentime where there were mainly gender differences most determinants were similarly related with both behaviours in both ses groups indicating no major moderation effect of ses on these relationships conclusions: this study revealed that already in the first years of educational differentiation levels of key pa determinants differ contributing to socioeconomic differences in pa the analyses identified the strongest mediators of the sespa association but additional investigation utilising longitudinal and experimental designs are needed this study demonstrates the usefulness of combining constructs from various theoretical approaches to better understand the role of distinct mechanisms that underpin socioeconomic health behaviour disparities

vast majority of practical engineering design problems require simultaneous handling of several criteria for the sake of simplicity and through a priori preference articulation one can turn many design tasks into singleobjective problems that can be handled using conventional numerical optimization routines however in some situations acquiring comprehensive knowledge about the system at hand in particular about possible tradeoffs between conflicting objectives may be necessary this calls for multi objective optimization that aims at identifying a set of alternative paretooptimal designs the most popular solution approaches include populationbased metaheuristics unfortunately such methods are not practical for problems involving expensive computational models this is particularly the case for microwave and antenna engineering where design reliability requires utilization of cpuintensive electromagnetic em analysis in this work we discuss methodologies for expedited multiobjective design optimization of expensive em simulation models the solution approaches that we present here rely on surrogatebased optimization sbo paradigm where the design speedup is obtained by shifting the optimization burden into a cheap replacement model the surrogate the latter is utilized for generating the initial approximation of the pareto front representation as well as further front refinement to elevate it to the highfidelity em simulation model level we demonstrate several application case studies including a wideband matching transformer a dielectric resonator antenna and an ultrawideband monopole antenna dimensionality of the design spaces in the considered examples vary from six to fifteen and the design optimization cost is about one hundred of highfidelity em simulations of the respective structure which is extremely low given the problem complexity c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
nonlinear similarity measures defined in kernel space such as correntropy can extract higher order statistics of data and offer potentially significant performance improvement over their linear counterparts especially in non gaussian signal processing and machine learning in this paper we propose a new similarity measure in kernel space called the kernel risksensitive loss krsl and provide some important properties we apply the krsl to adaptive filtering and investigate the robustness and then develop the mkrsl algorithm and analyze the mean square convergence performance compared with correntropy the krsl can offer a more efficient performance surface thereby enabling a gradientbased method to achieve faster convergence speed and higher accuracy while still maintaining the robustness to outliers theoretical analysis results and superior performance of the new algorithm are confirmed by simulation
eimeria maxima is one of the most pathogenic species of avian coccidia yet it is unknown why different e maxima strains differ in the pathogenic effects they cause in chickens the purpose of this study was to determine if a more pathogenic e maxima strain apu1 was also more fecund than a less pathogenic e maxima strain apu2 at identical doses e maxima apu1 always produces greater intestinal lesions and lower weight gain compared to e maxima apu2 using a dose response study median and mean intestinal lesion scores in e maxima apu2infected chickens were greater by a score of 115 compared to chickens infected with e maxima apu2 likewise weight gain depression in e maxima apu1infected chickens was 2025% greater equivalent to 110130 g body weight than in e maxima apu2infected chickens in order to understand the underlying cause of these observed clinical effects 120 broiler chicks 5 oocyst levels 6 replicates/level were inoculated with various doses of e maxima apu1 or apu2 oocysts the dynamics of oocyst shedding was investigated by collecting fecal material every 12 h from 114 to 210 h postinoculation pi and every 24 h thereafter from 210 to 306 h and then processed for measuring e maxima oocyst output oocysts were first observed at 138 h pi and time of peak oocyst production was nearly identical for both e maxima apu1 and apu2 around 150162 h total oocyst production was 1126 fold higher at all dose levels for e maxima apu1 compared to e maxima apu2 being significantly higher p <005 at the log 15 dose level other groups of chickens were infected with higher doses of e maxima apu1 or apu2 oocysts and intestinal lesions were assessed by histology at 72 96 120 and 144h pi although schizonts gamonts and oocysts were observed at expected timepoints no obvious differences were noted in lesions induced by the two e maxima strains this study showed that the greater fecundity of e maxima apu1 compared to e maxima apu2 explains in part the observed differences in pathogenicity of the two e maxima strains but that other factors may contribute to differences in observed clinical effects

effective interpersonal coordination is fundamental to robust social interaction and the ability to anticipate a coactor's behavior is essential for achieving this coordination however coordination research has focused on the behavioral synchrony that occurs between the simple periodic movements of coactors and thus little is known about the anticipation that occurs during complex everyday interaction research on the dynamics of coupled neurons human motor control electrical circuits and laser semiconductors universally demonstrates that small temporal feedback delays are necessary for the anticipation of chaotic events we therefore investigated whether similar feedback delays would promote anticipatory behavior during social interaction results revealed that coactors were not only able to anticipate others' chaotic movements when experiencing small perceptualmotor delays but also exhibited movement patterns of equivalent complexity this suggests that such delays including those within the human nervous system may enhance rather than hinder the anticipatory processes that underlie successful social interaction

the internet of things iot has inspired solutions that are already available for addressing problems in various application scenarios such as healthcare security emergency support and tourism however there is no clear approach to modeling these systems and envisioning their capabilities at the design time therefore the process of designing these systems is ad hoc and its real impact is evaluated once the solution is already implemented which is risky and expensive this paper proposes a modeling approach that uses humancentric wireless sensor networks to specify and evaluate models of iotbased systems at the time of design avoiding the need to spend time and effort on early implementations of immature designs it allows designers to focus on the system design leaving the implementation decisions for a next phase the article illustrates the usefulness of this proposal through a running example showing the design of an iotbased solution to support the first responses during mediumsized or large urban incidents the case study used in the proposal evaluation is based on a real train crash the proposed modeling approach can be used to design iotbased systems for other application scenarios e g to support security operatives or monitor chronic patients in their homes

spectral methods are an efficient way to solve partial differential equations on domains possessing certain symmetries the utility of a method depends strongly on the choice of spectral basis in this paper we describe a set of bases built out of jacobi polynomials and associated operators for solving scalar vector and tensor partial differential equations in polar coordinates on a unit disk by construction the bases satisfy regularity conditions at r 0 for any tensorial field the coordinate singularity in a disk is a prototypical case for many coordinate singularities the work presented here extends to other geometries the operators represent covariant derivatives multiplication by azimuthally symmetric functions and the tensorial relationship between fields these arise naturally from relations between classical orthogonal polynomials and form a heisenberg algebra other past work uses more specific polynomial bases for solving equations in polar coordinates the main innovation in this paper is to use a larger set of possible bases to achieve maximum bandedness of linear operations we provide a series of applications of the methods illustrating their easeofuse and accuracy c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of amyloidbeta as extracellular plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles tau pathology characterizes not only alzheimer's disease but also many other tauopathies presenting tau as an attractive therapeutic target passive tau immunotherapy has been previously explored; however because only a small fraction of peripherally delivered antibodies crosses the bloodbrain barrier enters the brain and engages with tau that forms intracellular aggregates more efficient ways of antibody delivery and neuronal uptake are warranted in the brain tau exists as multiple isoforms here we investigated the efficacy of a novel 2n tau isoformspecific single chain antibody fragment rn2n delivered by passive immunization in the p301l human tau transgenic pr5 mouse model we demonstrate that in treated mice rn2n reduces anxietylike behaviour and phosphorylation of tau at distinct sites when administration of rn2n was combined with focused ultrasound in a scanning mode scanning ultrasound rn2n delivery into the brain and uptake by neurons were markedly increased and efficacy was significantly enhanced our study provides evidence that scanning ultrasound is a viable tool to enhance the delivery of biologics across the bloodbrain barrier and improve therapeutic outcomes and further presents singlechain antibodies as an alternative to fulllength antibodies

performance of any digital control scheme applied to inverters or any other power electronic structures can significantly suffer due to time delays these time delays can be linear and nonlinear an example of a linear delay is the delay due to sampling control calculation and application of the new voltage state which results in a constant delay present in each control cycle an example of a nonlinear delay is the inverter deadtime which is different depending on the selected switching state and the direction of the load current both types of delays are wellknown and are addressedin literature at the same time the known solutions result in significantly more complicated hardware and/or software implementations introduction of mpc to power electronics gives a new and unique opportunity to compensate for both types of the delays in a clear and effective way this can be done by including the delays both linear and nonlinear in the model predictions as an illustration this paper presents an mpcbased design of closedloop current control with linear delay compensation for voltage source inverters the paper also proposes a variable rate mpcbased voltage modulator which combines harmonic suppression with inverter deadtime compensation the main points of the paper are illustrated by extensive simulation and experimenal results

introduction: an impairment of visually perceiving backward masked stimuli is commonly observed in patients with schizophrenia yet it is unclear whether this impairment is the result of a deficiency in first or higher order processing and for which subtypes of schizophrenia it is present methods: here we compare identification first order and metacognitive higher order performance in a visual masking paradigm between a highly homogenous group of young firstepisode patients diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia n 11 to that of carefully matched healthy controls n 13 results: we find no difference across groups in firstorder performance but find a difference in metacognitive performance particularly for stimuli with relatively high visibility conclusions: these results indicate that the masking deficit is present in firstepisode patients with paranoid schizophrenia but that it is primarily an impairment of metacognition

a novel type of hydraulic structure is proposed for rainwater harvesting in an arid area of jordan the project is to develop an irrigation scheme near the dead sea where low annual precipitation and high salinity are the major concerns the scheme consists of an irrigated farm a reservoir and an intake structure to divert ephemeral flood flows into the reservoir the harvested water is expected to be fresh in comparison with the groundwater in the vulnerable freshwater lens this research focusses on hydraulic design and actual construction processes of the structure the structure consists of a gutter cutting across a 16 m wide valley bottom and a conveyance channel of 60 m long to guide the water into the reservoir the conveyance channel is equipped with a spillway part as a result of level surveys and hydrological considerations it was revealed that the structure should have a width of 16 m and supercritical flows should be dominant details of structure dimensions were designed with numerical and model experiments a finite volume scheme for the twodimensional shallow water equations was used to numerically reproduce the whole flow field during a rainwater harvesting event with the maximum design discharge the numerical scheme employs special fluxsplitting and data reconstruction techniques that realize stable computation of very shallow transcritical flows a distorted hydraulic model with 1/8 horizontal scale and 1/1 roughness scale was constructed in an experimental station in japan in order to test hydraulic phenomena that the numerical method cannot represent then the structure was actually constructed at the site the channel bottoms are made of reinforced concrete while the side walls are of concrete blocks whose sizes have been chosen according to the design however minor changes were made during the construction processes due to workability constraints the numerical experiments were conducted again to confirm the actual structure showing desired performance
it has been widely accepted that reinforcement made of polyethylene and polypropylene is susceptible to creep and soil's hydraulic conductivity varies with its void ratio however unfortunately there is no available sensitivity analysis on timedependent embankment behaviour taking either reinforcement viscosity or time varying hydraulic conductivity of subsoil into consideration the influence of geosynthetic reinforcement viscosity and decreasing hydraulic conductivity with consolidation on the timedependent performance of embankments with floating columns is investigated using a fully 3d coupled model for an embankment at the working height corresponding to a postconsolidation polypropylene geotextile strain of about 5% it is shown that the assumption of constant hydraulic conductivity and the failure to consider the viscous behaviour of geosynthetic reinforcement can underestimate timedependent embankment deformations including differential crest settlement and horizontal toe movement the effects of factors including the foundation soil reinforcement stiffness column stiffness column spacing column type floating and fully penetrating and construction rate on the timedependent behaviour of column supported embankments are explored c 2015 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
parametric and implicit methods are traditionally thought to be two irrelevant approaches in structural shape optimization parametric method works as a lagrangian approach and often uses the parametric boundary representation brep of curves/surfaces for example bezier and bsplines in combination with the conformal mesh of a finite element model while implicit method relies upon levelset functions that is implicit functions for brep and works as an eulerian approach in combination with the fixed mesh within the scope of extended finite element method or finite cell method the original contribution of this work is the unification of both methods first a new shape optimization method is proposed by combining the features of the parametric and implicit breps shape changes of the structural boundary are governed by parametric brep on the fixed mesh to maintain the merit in computeraided design modeling and avoid laborious remeshing second analytical shape design sensitivity is formulated for the parametric brep in the framework of fixed mesh of finite cell method by means of the hamiltonjacobi equation numerical examples are solved to illustrate the unified methodology copyright c 2016 john wiley & sons ltd

friction properties at geotextile interfaces play an important role in the stability of geotextile encapsulatedsand systems in coastal protection the stabilising action of the frictional force is important to oppose sliding along the contact surface and to prevent deformations which may lead to structural failures this paper presents a set of experiments based on largescale direct shear tests performed under both cyclic loading and cyclic displacement conditions examining friction at interfaces between geotextile specimens sandfilled geosystem elements and between a sand layer and a sandfilled geosystem element the results presented here indicate that the friction parameters ie shear strength and friction angle derived from geotextile specimens are below those obtained for sandfilled elements which suggests that using the former for the stability analysis is conservative the tests carried out with a sand layer surface showed that a modification to the shear plane slope is likely to occur for the sandfilled geosystem element buries into the sand layer this deformation can result in toe instability ultimately leading to progressive damage or even collapse of the entire structure c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
background: shrimp and house dust mite hdm allergies are common in canadians often both of these allergies occur in the same patient this may be due to homology of tropomyosin or other potentially shared proteins the aim of our study was to assess the frequency of house dust mite sensitization in a shrimp allergic canadian population methods: we undertook a retrospective chart review of shrimp allergic patients at an outpatient allergy clinic in kitchener ontario canada our primary endpoint was to assess for presence of hdm sensitization in this population patients were categorized into approximate quartiles we assessed the severity of the shrimp reactions correlated shrimp skin test size to hdm skin test size and measured the proportion of patients with atopic symptoms results: we identified 95 shrimp allergic patients who were tested for house dust mite 86 905% of these patients had a positive skin test to hdm patients with a shrimp skin test >5 mm were 531 times 95% ci 1551814; p 0008 more likely to exhibit a dust mite skin test >5 mm than patients with a shrimp skin test < 5 mm the odds of a patient with a shrimp skin test between 10 and 18 mm having a larger hdm skin test were 393 times 95% ci 1031498 p 0045 the odds for a patient with a shrimp skin test size between 3 and 4 mm we did not find a correlation between shrimp skin test size and shrimp reaction symptom grade p 0301 conclusion: in our canadian patients we found a large majority of shrimp allergic patients to be sensitized to hdm we found that patients with a large skin test to shrimp were more likely to have a large skin test to hdm compared to those patients with a small skin test to shrimp we did not find a correlation between shrimp skin test size and shrimp reaction symptom severity most of these patients had symptoms of rhinitis and/or asthma that may have been caused by house dust mite allergy
objective: the programmed death1 receptor pd1 is a negative regulator of tcell activation the pd13 polymorphism of the pd1 gene pdcd1 has been previously shown to be associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis we examined for the first time pd13 association with another inflammatory disease with strong immune component igemediated bronchial asthma its severity and its biochemical markers total serum ige and il4 methods: pd13 g/a was genotyped by pcrrflp analysis using two different populations: caucasian 492 russian individuals and asian 276 buryat individuals results: we found a significant association of the pd13 polymorphism with igemediated bronchial asthma and total serum ige level in the russian population combined genotype aa+ag was correlated with risk of developing allergic bronchial asthma or 178 95% ci 113278 p 0011 and lower concentrations of total serum ige p 0001 compared with the wildtype genotype gg however pd13 was not polymorphic in the buryat population conclusions: pd13 polymorphism of the pd1 gene pdcd1 may contribute to the development of allergic asthma in the russians but not in the buryats our results could be helpful for a better understanding of the effect of this polymorphism on the development of diseases with strong immune components
introduction: this article is part of the focus theme of methods of information in medicine on pervasive intelligent technologies for health background: effective nonverbal communication between patients and clinicians fosters both the delivery of empathic patientcentered care and positive patient outcomes although nonverbal skill training is a recognized need few efforts to enhance patientclinician communication provide visual feedback on nonverbal aspects of the clinical encounter objectives: we describe a novel approach that uses social signal processing technology ssp to capture nonverbal cues in real time and to display ambient visual feedback on control and affiliation two primary yet distinct dimensions of interpersonal nonverbal communication to examine the design and clinician acceptance of ambient visual feedback on nonverbal communication we 1 formulated a model of relational communication to ground ssp and 2 conducted a formative user study using mixed methods to explore the design of visual feedback methods: based on a model of relational communication we reviewed interpersonal communication research to map nonverbal cues to signals of affiliation and control evidenced in patientclinician interaction corresponding with our formulation of this theoretical framework we designed ambient realtime visualizations that reflect variations of affiliation and control to explore clinicians' acceptance of this visual feedback we conducted a lab study using the wizardofoz technique to simulate system use with 16 healthcare professionals we followed up with seven of those participants through interviews to iterate on the design with a revised visualization that addressed emergent design considerations results: ambient visual feedback on nonverbal communication provides a theoretically grounded and acceptable way to provide clinicians with awareness of their nonverbal communication style we provide implications for the design of such visual feedback that encourages empathic patientcentered communication and include considerations of metaphor color size position and timing of feedback conclusions: ambient visual feedback from ssp holds promise as an acceptable means for facilitating empathic patientcentered nonverbal communication

little is known about how the virulence of a human pathogen varies in the environment it shares with its vector this study focused on whether the virulence of trypanosoma cruzi trypanosomatida: trypanosomatidae the causal agent of chagas' disease is related to altitude accordingly triatoma dimidiata hemiptera: reduviidae specimens were collected at three different altitudes 300 700 and 1400 m a s l in chiapas mexico the parasite was then isolated to infect uninfected t dimidiata from the same altitudes as well as female cd1 mice the response variables were phenoloxidase po activity a key insect immune response parasitaemia in mice and amastigote numbers in the heart oesophagus gastrocnemius and brain of the rodents the highest levels of po activity parasitaemia and amastigotes were found for tryp cruzi isolates sourced from 700 m a s l particularly in the mouse brain a polymerase chain reactionbased analysis indicated that all tryp cruzi isolates belonged to a tryp cruzi i lineage thus tryp cruzi from 700 m a s l may be more dangerous than sources at other altitudes at this altitude t dimidiata is more common apparently because the conditions are more beneficial to its development control strategies should focus activity at altitudes around 700 m a s l at least in relation to the region of the present study sites
this paper addresses the problem of finding credible sources among twitter social network users to detect and prevent various malicious activities such as spreading false information on a potentially inflammatory topic forging accounts for false identities etc existing research works related to source credibility are graphbased considering the relationships among users to predict the spread information; humanbased using human perspectives to determine reliable sources; or machine learningbased relying on training classifiers to predict users' credibility very few of these approaches consider a user's sentimentality when analyzing his/her credibility as a source in this paper we propose a novel approach that combines analysis of the user's reputation on a given topic within the social network as well as a measure of the user's sentiment to identify topically relevant and credible sources of information in particular we propose a new reputation metric that introduces several new features into the existing models we evaluated the performance of the proposed metric in comparison with two machine learning techniques determining that the accuracy of the proposed approach satisfies the stated purpose of identifying credible twitter users copyright c 2016 john wiley & sons ltd
in many lowtomid power applications critical mode boost power factor corrector converters are widely used because of its low switching loss and simple control however near the zero crossing of the input line voltage an input current distortion and a low power factor are caused by delayed switching period and negative input currents generally an additional ontime method according to the input voltage is used to compensate the input current distortion however a detailed quantitative analysis for the exact additional on time has not been studied till now in this paper the explicit form of the optimized additional on time has been obtained using a quantitative analysis and the advantage of the digital control from a state trajectory and net input charge analysis it is shown that the optimized on time should be related to not only the input voltage but also the output power also in order to improve the efficiency in a high input and light load condition circulating currents are reduced in the inevitable dead angle with a gate turningoff technique by using digital control the optimized additional on time and the gate turnoff technique have been implemented with the 90230 vrms input and 380 v/200 w output prototype
in recent years it has become easy for people who are far apart to communicate by telephone or email however neither the telephone nor email can create the feeling that two people are sharing the same space if it were possible to feel physically close to someone far away our ability to communicate would be significantly enriched the purpose of this study is to propose a system of communication that would enable two people to feel as if they were in the same place despite being far apart the first experiment was conducted using 12 types of visual information to ascertain which types of visual information most effectively created the illusion that two separated people were sharing the same space this experiment showed that simple visual information was more effective than more complex visual information at creating the illusion of shared space based on these results our research team was able to propose a new system of communication using a table and various projected visual objects in this system if a participant put a hot drink for example a cup of coffee on the table a red circle would appear and blink slowly in the same position on the other person's table before fading away conversely if the participant put a cold drink on the table a blue circle would be projected onto the other person's table in the same position if the first person moved the cup or glass on his or her own table the red or blue circle would repeat the move blink slowly and then fade away on the other person's table the second experiment used 14 participants to ascertain the effectiveness of the proposed communication system we found that 71 % of participants who used the proposed communication system felt that the person they were communicating with shared the same space moreover participants felt that the proposed communication system enhanced communication making it feel more proactive it was clear that participants experienced this sense of a shared space more strongly when the circle moved than when it blinked or faded away these results suggest that the proposed communication system using a table and various projected visual objects did succeed in creating the impression that two people in different locations were sharing the same space
this paper addresses the need to enhance transparency in ambient intelligent environments by developing more natural ways of interaction which allow the users to communicate easily with the hidden networked devices rather than embedding obtrusive tablets and computing equipment throughout their surroundings ambient intelligence vision aims to realize digital environments that adapt to users in a responsive transparent and contextaware manner in order to enhance users' comfort it is therefore appropriate to employ the paradigm of computing with words cwws which aims to mimic the ability of humans to communicate transparently and manipulate perceptions via words one of the daily activities that would increase the comfort levels of the users especially people with disabilities is cooking and performing tasks in the kitchen existing approaches on food preparation cooking and recipe recommendation stress on healthy eating and balanced meal choices while providing limited personalization features through the use of intrusive user interfaces herein we present an application which transparently interacts with users based on a novel cwws approach in order to predict the recipe's difficulty level and to recommend an appropriate recipe depending on the user's mood appetite and spare time the proposed cwws framework is based on linear general type2 lgt2 fuzzy sets which linearly quantify the linguistic modifiers in the third dimension in order to better represent the user perceptions while avoiding the drawbacks of type1 and interval type2 fuzzy sets the lgt2based cwws framework can learn from user experiences and adapt to them in order to establish more natural humanmachine interaction we have carried numerous realworld experiments with various users in the university of essex intelligent flat the comparison analysis between interval type2 fuzzy sets and lgt2 fuzzy sets demonstrates up to 5543% improvement when general type2 fuzzy sets are used than when interval type2 fuzzy sets are used instead the quantitative and qualitative analysis both show the success of the system in providing a natural interaction with the users for recommending food recipes where the quantitative analysis shows the high statistical correlation between the system output and the users' feedback; the qualitative analysis presents social science evaluation confirming the strong user acceptance of the system
background: evidence indicates that substancerelated cognitive biases attentional memory and approach bias contribute to the maintenance and development of substance misuse impulsivity has been suggested to influence how cognitive biases contribute to substance misuse possibly by biasing incentive salience attribution processes however the strength and moderators of the relationship between impulsivity and substancerelated cognitive biases has yet to be empirically examined methods: a metaanalysis using randomeffects models was completed assessing 19 studies that reported a quantitative relationship between an impulsivity measure and a substancerelated cognitive bias twocomponent conceptualisation of impulsivity impulsivity measurement type gender and age were assessed as moderators results: a small significant positive relationship r010 was observed between impulsivity and substancerelated attentional memory and approach biases no moderators examined had a significant influence on this relationship conclusions: results are consistent with incentive sensitisation theories of addiction and suggests a weak synergistic relationship between impulsivity and substancerelated cognitive biases this relationship holds across different measures and components of impulsivity results provide some support for the viability of impulsivity and cognitive bias interaction models which may warrant further investigation of these factors in relation to predicting addiction treatment outcomes crown copyright c 2017 published by elsevier ireland ltd all lights reserved
the transport properties and mechanisms of fractured porous media are very important for oil and gas reservoir engineering hydraulics environmental science chemical engineering etc in this paper a fractal dualporosity model is developed to estimate the equivalent hydraulic properties of fractured porous media where a fractal treelike network model is used to characterize the fracture system according to its fractal scaling laws and topological structures the analytical expressions for the effective permeability of fracture system and fractured porous media tortuosity fracture density and fraction are derived the proposed fractal model has been validated by comparisons with available experimental data and numerical simulation it has been shown that fractal dimensions for fracture length and aperture have significant effect on the equivalent hydraulic properties of fractured porous media the effective permeability of fracture system can be increased with the increase of fractal dimensions for fracture length and aperture while it can be remarkably lowered by introducing tortuosity at large branching angle also a scaling law between the fracture density and fractal dimension for fracture length has been found where the scaling exponent depends on the fracture number the present fractal dualporosity model may shed light on the transport physics of fractured porous media and provide theoretical basis for oil and gas exploitation underground water nuclear waste disposal and geothermal energy extraction as well as chemical engineering etc
marangoni convection in a volatile liquid film subject to a horizontal temperature gradient confined in a rectangular cavity is a basic problem of heat transfer and fluid mechanics with applications in evaporative cooling the marangoni stresses that drive this flow are due to surface tension gradients at the liquidvapor interface the thermocapillary stresses due to variations in surface tension with temperature for the most part drive the liquid away from hot regions a volatile binaryfluid mixture can however be designed so that the solutocapillary stresses due to variations in surface tension with concentration drive the liquid instead towards hot regions and hence oppose thermocapillary stresses in thicker liquid layers the flow is also affected by buoyancy this work details an experimental study of buoyancymarangoni convection in a similar to 031 cm deep layer of methanolwater meohh2o in a sealed rectangular cuvette driven by a temperature difference of similar to 6 degrees c over a horizontal distance of 49 cm particle pathline visualizations and particleimage velocimetry piv were used to study this flow and determine how the liquid composition quantified in terms of the meoh concentration cm and noncondensables ie air quantified by the concentration of air in the gas space above the liquid c a affect the flow solutocapillary effects are strong enough to drive the liquid near the free surface towards the heated end over the entire horizontal extent of the liquid layer at low ca ie c a < 6% suggesting that binaryfluid coolants could significantly reduce film dryout this flow driven by thermocapillarity solutocapillarity and buoyancy is classified into four distinct flow regimes that are summarized in a ca vs cm flow regime map c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the pairing of computeraided design and geographical information system data creates an opportunity to connect an architectural design process with a robust analysis of its environmental constraints yet the geographical information system data may be too overwhelmingly complex to be fully used in computeraided design without computerassisted methods of filtering relevant information this article reports on the implementation of an integrated environment for threedimensional computeraided design and environmental impact the project focused on a twoway data exchange between geographical information system and computeraided design in building design while the two different technologies may rely on separate representational models in combination they can provide a more complete view of the natural and built environment the challenge in integration is that of bridging the differences in analytical methods and database formats our approach is rooted in part in constraintbased design methods well established in computeraided design eg sketchpad generative components and computeraided threedimensional interactive application within such computeraided design systems geometrical transformations may be intentionally constrained to help enforce a set of design determinants although this current implementation modestly relates to geometrical constraints the use of probabilistic risk values is more central to its methodology
machine design is the most perspective field of study in the faculty of mechanical engineering fme at the university of west bohemia with regards to the demand for graduates in this field these days the main issue of higher education in the czech republic related to machine design is the lack of opportunities for students of machine design to acquire practical knowledge and experience in the field the problem is that engineering companies offer work experience only to individual students as they try to hire them after graduation but engineering companies are not motivated enough to contribute to the machine design teaching process by providing knowledge and experience to the majority of students as this is not going to change soon universities have to provide real applications to its students instead currently there are not enough opportunities for students to acquire practical knowledge in the field during their studies the required amount of work experience for engineering students in the czech republic is only one week which is insufficient in comparison with the german system where internship semesters are a mandatory part of studying at a fachhochschule university of applied sciences it is necessary to provide practical information and real applications in class to compensate for the lack of practical experience fme is concerned in this matter and it has launched the project for enhancement of the teaching process a new concept of electronic learning materials for machine design was developed as a part of the project the learning materials were developed by academics in cooperation with local engineering companies to provide students and academics at fme with real design projects reworked for learning purposes the machine design teaching process is complicated due to the complexity of the mechanical design process as it has its own particularities which need to be considered while creating learning materials when describing the mechanical design process not only the design process itself has to be described also the production processes project schedules economic aspects of the design project legislative technical standards and regulations have to be described as well as these parts of the mechanical design process affect each other it is important to describe them in the context of the mechanical design process to show the interconnection between them the electronic form of learning materials was selected as it offers many advantages over the standard printed form the main reason for selecting the electronic form of learning materials is the ability to work with computeraided engineering cae models threedimensional cae models replaced drawing boards in every engineering company several years ago and thus it is important to include cae models in the machine design teaching process thanks to the technology of exporting cae models to the standard portable document format pdf it is possible to modify cae models for learning purposes and use them as a learning tool cae models can be enhanced with a large amount of information regarding a design project such as manufacturing processes materials or component functions and can be supplemented by technical drawings illustrated project descriptions and further information all the learning material is converted into a single pdf file so that every student can access it anywhere anytime versatility and interactivity are the biggest benefits of the new electronic learning materials the new electronic learning materials can be used when explaining new subject matter to show its application or as a basis for students' assignments individual work teamwork or dissertations the sample electronic learning materials are being produced and will be made available to students through the courseware of the university of west bohemia this paper intends to present the learning materials and describe their form structure and content and their benefits for academics and students of machine design

visual tracking which has been widely used in many vision fields has been one of the most active research topics in computer vision in recent years however there are still challenges in visual tracking such as illumination change object occlusion and appearance deformation to overcome these difficulties a reliable point assignment rpa algorithm based on wavelet transform is proposed the reliable points are obtained by searching the location that holds local maximal wavelet coefficients since the local maximal wavelet coefficients indicate high variation in the image the reliable points are robust against image noise illumination change and appearance deformation moreover a kalman filter is applied to the detection step to speed up the detection processing and reduce false detection finally the proposed rpa is integrated into the trackinglearningdetection tld framework with the kalman filter which not only improves the tracking precision but also reduces the false detections experimental results showed that the new framework outperforms tld and kernelized correlation filters with respect to precision fmeasure and average overlap in percent
humans exhibit extensive largescale cooperation of a form unprecedented in the natural world here i suggest that this cooperation arises in our species alone because of our uniquely potent capacities for social learning imitation and teaching combined with the coevolutionary feedbacks that these capabilities have generated on the human mind culture took human populations down evolutionary pathways not available to noncultural species either by creating conditions that promoted established cooperative mechanisms such as indirect reciprocity and mutualism or by generating novel cooperative mechanisms not seen in other taxa such as cultural group selection in the process geneculture coevolution seemingly generated an evolved psychology comprising an enhanced ability and motivation to learn teach communicate through language imitate and emulate as well as predispositions to docility social tolerance and the sharing of goals intentions and attention this evolved psychology is entirely different from that observed in any other animal or that could have evolved through conventional selection on genes alone
seepage plays an important role in soil erosion in contour ridge systems seepage generated from subsurface flow causes hillslope instability by reducing the soil shear strength and mobilizing soil particles and can produce cavelike features called seepage undercuts that can lead to contour failure as the main threat to contour plowing seepage results in large amounts of soil erosion due to row grade models used to predict seepage over a time series will provide a basis for modeling soil erosion resulting from seepage in contour ridging systems understanding seepage and its effects will advance our knowledge regarding seepage erosion mechanisms in contour ridge systems in this study 23 treatments were arranged using an orthogonal rotatable central composite design to model a seepage time series build a simple seepage prediction model and investigate the effects of row grade field slope and ridge height on seepage discharge most of the seepage discharge time series followed an sshaped curve the seepage discharge processes were fit by an exponential model with a determination coefficients r2 greater than 0995 furthermore the physical meaning of the exponential model was consistent with the experimental results the seepage discharge continuously increased before the inflection point and then decreased finally the seepage discharge approached a steady value the maximum seepage discharge growth rate was achieved within 14 min and the seepage discharge became steady within 106 min secondorder polynomial regression models were used to determine the total and predicted steady seepage discharge using independent variables of row grade field slope and ridge height which produced r2 values of 066 p < 005 and 068 p < 005 respectively ridge height and row grade significantly affected p < 005 the total and predicted steady seepage discharge field slope and its related factors was ignored because it had no significant effects on seepage discharge the effects of row grade resulted in a concave curve with an increasing factor value and ridge height exerted a positive linear effect on seepage discharge c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved

introduction: depressive symptoms are very common in patients with parkinson's disease pd and have a significant impact on the quality of life methods: the present study analyzed the correlations between overtime changes in depressive symptoms and gray matter parameters of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in nondemented pd patients results: a significant correlation was observed between increased scores for depression over time and lower cortical thickness over time in the right temporoparietal junction right occipital medial region right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex right posterior cingulate region left middle temporal as well as left supplementary motor area furthermore the presence of depressive symptoms at baseline predicted increased cortical thinning over time in the left middle temporal left anterior cingulate right posterior cingulate and right parahippocampal cortices finally a statistically significant negative correlation has been revealed between the thalamus' volume changes over time and the change in depressive symptoms scores all other analyzed subcortical structures didn't reveal any significant correlations conclusion: these results suggest that depressive symptoms in pd patients are associated with gray matter cortical thinning and thalamus volume shrinkage over time and higher scores of depressive symptoms at baseline correlate with a higher rate of cortical thinning longitudinally the present study highlights the importance of addressing depressive symptoms in pd patients early in the disease c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
the occurrence of repetitive behaviours that are often harmful has been attributed to traits traditionally described as impulsive or compulsive eg substance dependence excessive gambling and hoarding these behaviours are common and often cooccur in both the general population and psychiatric populations the lack of measures to concurrently index a range of such behaviours led to the development of the impulsivecompulsive behaviours icb checklist this study aims to validate the icb checklist in a general community sample factor analyses revealed a twofactor structure demonstrating good model fit in two independent samples these were labelled impulsivecompulsions and compulsiveimpulsions comprising of classically compulsive and impulsive behaviours respectively reliability and construct validity were further confirmed using correlations with existing measures of impulsivity and compulsivity results suggest that the icb checklist is a valid and practical assessment that can be used to monitor behavioural clusters characterised by deficits in inhibition c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
purpose: the physiological flow dynamics within the valsalva sinuses in terms of global and local parameters are still not fully understood this study attempts to identify the physiological conditions as closely as possible and to give an explanation of the different and sometime contradictory results in literature methods: an in vitro approach was implemented for testing porcine bioprosthetic valves operating within different aortic root configurations all tests were performed on a pulse duplicator under physiological pressure and flow conditions the fluid dynamics established in the various cases were analysed by means of 2d particle image velocimetry and related with the achieved hydrodynamic performance results: each configuration is associated with substantially different flow dynamics which significantly affects the valve performance the configuration most closely replicating healthy native anatomy was characterised by the best hemodynamic performance and any mismatch in size and position between the valve and the root produced substantial modification of the fluid dynamics downstream of the valve hindering the hydrodynamic performance of the system the worst conditions were observed for a configuration characterised by the total absence of the valsalva sinuses conclusion: this study provides an explanation for the different vortical structures described in the literature downstream of bioprosthetic valves enlightening the experimental complications in valve testing most importantly the results clearly identify the fluid mechanisms promoted by the valsalva sinuses to enhance the ejection and closing phases and this study exposes the importance of an optimal integration of the valve and root to operate as a single system c 2016 the authors published by elsevier ltd

countries are implementing policies to develop greener energy markets worldwide in europe the 2030 energy and climate package asks for further reductions of green house gases renewable sources integration and energy efficiency targets but the polluting intensity of electricity may be different in average than when considering market inefficiencies in particular losses and therefore the implemented policy must take those differences into account precisely herein we study the importance in terms of co2 emissions the extra amount of energy necessary to cover losses with this purpose we use spanish market and system data with hourly frequency from 2011 to 2013 our results show that indeed electricity losses significantly explain co2 emissions with a higher co2 emissions rate when covering losses than the average rate of the system additionally we find that the market closing technologies used to cover losses have a positive and significant impact on co2 emissions: when polluting technologies coal or combined cycle close the market the impact of losses on co2 emissions is high compared to the rest of technologies combined heat and power renewables or hydropower to the light of these results we make some policy recommendations to reduce the impact of losses on co2 emissions

psychological perspectivetaking is a powerful social cognition that helps us to understand other people it creates feelings of closeness and sympathy motivates us to help others and is important for positive social relationships in contrast to the impressive knowledge about its consequences relatively little is known about how exactly people achieve them the present paper addresses this question from a grounded cognition perspective drawing on recent findings on the embodiment of visuospatial perspectivetaking visuospatial perspectivetaking involves a mental transformation of one's body schema into the physical location of another person we argue that when people psychologically put themselves in another person's shoes this simulation of physical proximity happens too and is one source of perceived closeness in five experiments total n 1067 participants completed a visuospatial perspectivetaking task during half of the trials angular disparity between the target person and the participant was high and participants had to adopt the target's visual perspective which involves an embodied simulation during the remaining trials angular disparity was low and participants could solve the task egocentrically taking another's perspective led participants to adopt the thoughts of the target person more strongly experiments 13 and increased the perceived similarity of that person to the self experiment 4 and participants' liking of that person experiment 5 these effects were independent of task difficulty experiment 2 and only present during trials where an embodied transformation happened ie at high angular disparities; experiment 3 implications for psychological and visuospatial perspectivetaking research and related phenomena are discussed

hospitals have multiple data sources such as embedded systems monitors and sensors the number of data available is increasing and the information are used not only to care the patient but also to assist the decision processes the introduction of intelligent environments in health care institutions has been adopted due their ability to provide useful information for health professionals either in helping to identify prognosis or also to understand patient condition behind of this concept arises this intelligent system to track patient condition eg critic events in health care this system has the great advantage of being adaptable to the environment and user needs the system is focused in identifying critic events from data streaming eg vital signs and ventilation which is particularly valuable for understanding the patient's condition this work aims to demonstrate the process of creating an intelligent system capable of operating in a real environment using streaming data provided by ventilators and vital signs monitors its development is important to the physician because becomes possible crossing multiple variables in realtime by analyzing if a value is critic or not and if their variation has or not clinical importance
people can reliably distinguish the sex of faces across age groups rates of accuracy are lower for infants however likely because they lack the pronounced sexually dimorphic features that develop during puberty given that previous research has shown that perceivers categorize adult sex automatically we wondered whether this would extend to the faces of infants for whom sex is less legible we tested this using a semantic priming paradigm in which infant faces preceded the categorization of stereotypically male and female names results showed that participants categorized the sex of male names significantly faster following perceptions of male versus female infant faces though female faces did not significantly facilitate the processing of female names the asymmetry in interference for male but not female faces supports evidence for a male default in conceptions of sex among infants previously found for adults individuals may therefore process sex automatically in the absence of overt cues eg postpubertal sexually dimorphic features or stereotypical clothing providing additional evidence for the depth and flexibility of social categorization
treerings are precious natural archives to assess ecosystem variability over time xylem anatomy in woody tissue is a promising source of information in treerings since it is closely linked to tree hydraulics and carbon fixation however despite the rising interest for cell anatomy in dendrochronology still little is known about the interpretation of the variability of cell anatomical responses observed across different environments and species here we analyze cell anatomical responses to increasing summer drought on 18 trees from 3 conifer species picea obovata pinus sylvestris and larix sibirica growing in the transition zone between forest and steppe in the republic of khakassia russia analyses include the comparison of tracheid size distributions along climatic gradients and contrasting microtopography from 1986 to 2008 results indicate an overall decrease of earlywood tracheid lumen and cell wall thickness to high temperature and drought regardless of species and site conditions in particular an increase of one degree celsius during the summer caused up to 5% reduction of earlywood cell lumen and wall thickness these anatomical shifts suggest that a downscaling of hydraulic efficiency is not paralleled by increased hydraulic safety presumably due to carbon limitation based on the results of this case study we suggest that increasing drought stress might hamper the formation of a functional xylem structure thus being a possible trigger for a missacclimation causing longterm decline and higher exposure to hydraulic failures despite the promising study approach more studies including more data trees years and broader climatic gradients would be needed to further improve our mechanistic understanding c 2015 elsevier gmbh all rights reserved
this article juxtaposes results from an unmanned aerial vehicle uav and a terrestrial laser scanning tls survey conducted to determine land relief the determination of terrain relief is a task that requires precision in order to for example map natural and anthropogenic uplifts and subsidences of the land surface one of the problems encountered when using either method to determine relief is the impact of any vegetation covering the given site on the determination of the height of the site's surface in the discussed case the site was covered mostly in low vegetation grass in one part it had been mowed whereas in the other it was 3040 cm high an attempt was made to filter point clouds in such a way as to leave only those points that represented the land surface and to eliminate those whose height was substantially affected by the surrounding vegetation the reference land surface was determined from dense measurements obtained by means of a tacheometer and a rodmounted reflector this method ensures that the impact of vegetation is minimized a comparison of the obtained accuracy levels costs and effort related to each method leads to the conclusion that it is more efficient to use uav than to use tls for dense land relief modeling c 2017 international society for photogrammetry and remote sensing inc isprs published by elsevier bv all rights reserved

water pollution from industrial metro lodz ml poland made the ner river almost fishless in its middle lower course for most of the 19th and 20th century the new sewage treatment plant of ml and reduction of industry have caused pollution abatement there since the 1990s as a result the ner became repopulated which was shown by fish samples collected along its course in 20002012 multivariate statistical methods helped distinguish unpolluted i and ii in the upper course and recovered iii iv and v in the middlelower course sections of the river historical and present data indicated that section iii downstream of ml recovered least both before and during the study section v outflow one recovered most and its fish fauna almost exclusively native now displays high and stable biomass abundance and species richness including those of obligatory riverine species nonnative prussian carp's dominance followed the river degradation gradient ie was highest in section iii and in section v declined to almost absence this study shows that the revival of native fish fauna seems to be a method of restricting the dominance of this highly tolerant species despite the abatement storm events are very harmful to fish mostly in section iii because the ner discharge may then increase manifold and all storm water is drained by the ml combined sewer system to the ner in several hours other stressors are numerous dams and desorption of pollutants from sediment in the middle ner and perhaps pollutant inflow from agriculture or local urban areas some moderation of storm impact on water entering the ner from ml by constructing buffer reservoirs would probably cause further fish recovery in section iii c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
uncertainty monitoring is a core property of metacognition allowing individuals to adapt their decisionmaking strategies depending on the state of their knowledge although it has been argued that other animals share these metacognitive abilities only humans seem to possess the ability to explicitly communicate their own uncertainty to others it remains unknown whether this capacity is present early in development or whether it emerges later with the ability to verbally report one's own mental states here using a nonverbal memorymonitoring paradigm we show that 20montholds can monitor and report their own uncertainty infants had to remember the location of a hidden toy before pointing to indicate where they wanted to recover it in an experimental group infants were given the possibility to ask for help through nonverbal communication when they had forgotten the toy location compared with a control group in which infants had no other option but to decide by themselves infants given the opportunity to ask for help used this option strategically to improve their performance asking for help was used selectively to avoid making errors and to decline difficult choices these results demonstrate that infants are able to successfully monitor their own uncertainty and share this information with others to fulfill their goals

introduction: molecular tests that were once ancillary to the core business of cytohistopathology are becoming the most relevant workload in pathology departments after histopathology/cytopathology and before autopsies this has resulted from innovations in molecular biology techniques which have developed at an incredibly fast paceareas covered: most of the current widely used techniques in molecular pathology such as fish direct sequencing pyrosequencing and allelespecific pcr will be replaced by massive parallel sequencing that will not be considered next generation but rather will be considered to be current generation sequencing the preanalytical steps of molecular techniques such as dna extraction or sample preparation will be largely automated moreover all the molecular pathology instruments will be part of an integrated workflow that traces the sample from extraction to the analytical steps until the results are reported; these steps will be guided by expert laboratory information systems in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for quantification will be largely digitalized as much as histology will be mostly digitalized rather than viewed using microscopyexpert commentary: this review summarizes the technical and regulatory issues concerning the standardization of molecular tests in pathology a vision of the future perspectives of technological changes is also provided
existing research shows that appeals to selfinterest sometimes increase and sometimes decrease prosocial behavior we propose that this inconsistency is in part due to the framings of these appeals different framings generate different salient reference points leading to different assessments of the appeal study 1 demonstrates that buying an item with the proceeds going to charity evokes a different set of alternative behaviors than donating and receiving an item in return studies 2 and 3ag establish that people are more willing to act and give more when they do when reading the former framing than the latter study 4 establishes ecological validity by replicating the effect in a field experiment assessing participants' actual charitable contributions finally study 5 provides additional process evidence via moderation for the proposed mechanism we discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings and suggest avenues for future research c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved

in mammals centromere definition involves the histone variant cenpa centromere protein a deposited by its chaperone hjurp holliday junction recognition protein alterations in this process impair chromosome segregation and genome stability which are also compromised by p53 inactivation in cancer here we found that cenpa and hjurp are transcriptionally upregulated in p53null human tumors using an established mouse embryonic fibroblast mef model combining p53 inactivation with e1a or hrasv12 oncogene expression we reproduced a similar upregulation of hjurp and cenpa we delineate functional cde/chr motifs within the hjurp and cenpa promoters and demonstrate their roles in p53mediated repression to assess the importance of hjurp upregulation in transformed murine and human cells we used a crispr/cas9 approach remarkably depletion of hjurp leads to distinct outcomes depending on their p53 status functional p53 elicits a cell cycle arrest response whereas in p53null transformed cells the absence of arrest enables the loss of hjurp to induce severe aneuploidy and ultimately apoptotic cell death we thus tested the impact of hjurp depletion in preestablished allograft tumors in mice and revealed a major block of tumor progression in vivo we discuss a model in which an epigenetic addiction to the hjurp chaperone represents an achilles' heel in p53deficient transformed cells
ambient assisted living aal technologies have the potential to target the challenges of our aging population however little is known about what motivates older adults to adopt these new technologies most research in this area relies on single cases with a specific aal application and a limited number of users to fill this gap a content analyses of 35 aal reports was conducted the aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of potential incentives for using aal technologies the data was coded using the social cognitive theory sct in total 13 incentives could be identified which were grouped into six categories: 1 social incentives 2 health and safety incentives 3 activity incentives 4 novel sensory incentives 5 status incentives and 6 selfreactive incentives within these categories 'social connectedness' and 'health and safety' were the most important incentives these results provide a comprehensive and theoretically grounded understanding of what motivates older adults to adopt aal technologies

as a result of the integration of different methodological tools life cycle assessment and dynamics simulation and studies to evaluate the economic cost and the potential environmental impact of alternative water supplies rainwater and greywater for urban use the software program plugrisost pluvials greys and sustainability has been developed this modelling tool aims to contribute to urban water planning for smart city development plugrisost is a simulation model that facilitates the evaluation of rainwater harvesting rwh and greywater systems at different scales of urban planning it is the only tool known thus far to integrate structural elements such as the sizing of storage tanks estimated cost and quantitative environmental analysis plugrisost can be an adequate tool in the design stage because it provides environmental and economic information related to rainwater tank sizing and its estimates are more conservative than those of other tools plugrisost contributes to the design of urban infrastructure of low environmental impact such as infrastructure that incorporates the use of rainwater and the selfsufficiency analysis of water in cities using plugrisost we have found that on the singlehouse scale the economic viability of an rwh system would be possible if the price of water is greater than 4 euros/m 3 ; and the environmental analysis would be favourable to tanks with less than 5 m 3 of storage capacity on the apartmentbuilding scale the results are 14 euros/m 3 and 33 m 3 respectively c 2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
past research showed that people accumulate more knowledge about other people and objects they like compared to those they dislike more knowledge is commonly assumed to lead to more differentiated mental representations; therefore people should perceive others they like as less similar to one another than others they dislike we predict the opposite outcome based on the density hypothesis unkelbach fiedler bayer stegmtiller & danner 2008 ; accordingly positive impressions are less diverse than negative impressions as there are only a few ways to be liked but many ways to be disliked therefore people should perceive liked others as more similar to one another than disliked others even though they have more knowledge about liked others seven experiments confirm this counterintuitive prediction and show a strong association between liking and perceived similarity in person perception we discuss the implications of these results for different aspects of person perception c 2015 elsevier inc all rights reserved

the quantitative simulation of forest fire spreading plays an essential role in designing quick risk management and implementing effective suppression policies as a preferable modelling approach the cellular automaton ca has been used to simulate the complex mechanisms of fire spreading however in traditional ca models comprehensive studies on the physical principles of forest fires are needed to define the local transition rules instead of defining transition rules the extreme learning machine elm was applied in this study by integrating the elm with the traditional forest fire ca framework a new cellular automaton modelling approach was proposed after that its performance was validated using data collected from five fires in the west of united states results show that the elm performed well in predicting each cell's igniting probability the impact of wind velocity on fire spreading pattern can be effectively described by the proposed modelling approach furthermore the validation against actual fire behavior observations shows that its simulation performance is acceptable and in most cases is better than that of the previously reported studies c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved
the integrity of a reactor pressure vessel rpv has to be ensured throughout its entire life in accordance with the applicable regulations typically an assessment of the rpv against brittle failure needs to be conducted by taking into account all possible loading cases one of the most severe loading cases which can potentially occur during the operating time is the lossofcoolant accident where cold water is injected into the rpv nearly at operating conditions high pressure in combination with a thermal shock of the ferritic pressure vessel wall caused by the injection of cold water leads to a considerable load at the beltline area known as pressurized thermal shock pts usually the assessment against brittle failure is based on a deterministic fracturemechanics analysis in which common parameters like jintegral or stress intensity factor are employed to calculate the load path for an assumed postulated flaw during the pts event the most important input data for the fracture mechanics analysis is the transient thermalhydraulics th load of the rpv during the emergency cooling such data can be calculated by analytical fluidmixing codes verified on experiments such as kwumix or by numerical computational fluid dynamics cfd tools after suitable validation in kwumix which is the standard used for th calculations within pts analyses rather conservative analytical models for the quantification of mixing and depending on the water level condensation processes in the downcomer including simplified stripe and plume formations are utilized on the contrary the numerical cfd tools can provide bestestimate results due to the possibility to consider more realistically the stripe and plume formations as well as the geometry of the rpv in detail in order to quantify the safety margin inherent to the standard approach two fracturemechanics analyses of the rpv beznau 1 based on thermalhydraulic input data from kwumix and cfd analyses were performed subsequently the resulting loading paths were compared between each other and with material properties obtained from the irradiation surveillance program of the rpv to demonstrate the exclusion of brittlefracture initiation

dishevelled dvl not only links the canonical wnt and noncanonical wnt pathways but can also crosstalk with other pathways as there is no systematic study to date on dvl in rheumatoid arthritis ra we explored the impact of dvl2 on proliferation and inflammatory cytokine secretion in ra fibroblastlike synoviocytes flss expression of dvl2 in ra synovial tissue and raflss was measured dvl2 was overexpressed in collageninduced arthritis rats and human raflss the apoptosis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were observed genetic changes and corresponding mechanisms caused by overexpressing dvl2 in raflss were assessed dvl2 was found to be overexpressed in ra synovial tissue and raflss overexpression of dvl2 increased apoptosis and inhibited inflammatory cytokine secretion by raflss in vivo and in vitro and dvl2 inhibited expression of antiapoptotic and inflammatory genes one possible mechanism is that dvl2 decreases the nuclear translocation of p65 and inhibits its ability to bind to the promoters of nfkappa b target genes our findings reveal an underappreciated role of dvl2 in regulating inflammation and rafls apoptosis and provide insight into crosstalk between the wnt and nuclear factorkappa b nfkappa b pathways
whether superiors or subordinates are more accurate in assessing the emotions of others aka emotion recognition accuracy era is a question that has gained much interest but yielded decidedly mixed empirical results the present study investigates whether superiors and subordinates who are in an actual hierarchical relationship differ in their era we investigated 142 superiors who each had recruited one of his or her direct subordinates total n 284 superiors and subordinates each took a paperpencil version of a standardized era test results showed that superiors were more accurate in assessing the emotions of other persons than subordinates were
implicit moral evaluations ie immediate unintentional assessments of the wrongness of actions or persons play a central role in supporting moral behavior in everyday life yet little research has employed methods that rigorously measure individual differences in implicit moral evaluations in five experiments we develop a new sequential priming measure the moral categorization task and a multinomial model that decomposes judgment on this task into multiple component processes these include implicit moral evaluations of moral transgression primes unintentional judgment accurate moral judgments about target actions intentional judgment and a directional tendency to judge actions as morally wrong response bias speeded response deadlines reduced intentional judgment but not unintentional judgment experiment 1 unintentional judgment was stronger toward moral transgression primes than nonmoral negative primes experiments 24 intentional judgment was associated with increased errorrelated negativity a neurophysiological indicator of behavioral control experiment 4 finally people who voted for an antigay marriage amendment had stronger unintentional judgment toward gay marriage primes experiment 5 across experiments 14 implicit moral evaluations converged with moral personality: unintentional judgment about wrong primes but not negative primes was negatively associated with psychopathic tendencies and positively associated with moral identity and guilt proneness theoretical and practical applications of formal modeling for moral psychology are discussed c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
this study addresses the applicability and financial feasibility of residential rainwater harvesting systems in the city of austin texas a costbenefit analysis is used to estimate the financial return for individual households with rainwater harvesting systems in addition a subsidy value that could be provided by the delay of a wastewater treatment plant expansion project is investigated the findings suggest that a residential rainwater harvesting system would not be feasible without a sufficient subsidy the estimated subsidy is also not enough to make the cost of the harvesting system effective; however its multipurpose benefits are not quantified
there remains conflict in the literature about the lateralisation of affective face perception some studies have reported a right hemisphere advantage irrespective of valence whereas others have found a left hemisphere advantage for positive and a right hemisphere advantage for negative emotion differences in injury aetiology and chronicity proportion of male participants participant age and the number of emotions used within a perception task may contribute to these contradictory findings the present study therefore controlled and/or directly examined the influence of these possible moderators right braindamaged rbd; n 17 left braindamaged lsd; n 17 and healthy control hc; n 34 participants completed two face perception tasks identification and discrimination no group differences in facial expression perception according to valence were found across emotions the rbd group was less accurate than the hc group however rbd and lbd group performance did not differ the lack of difference between rbd and lbd groups indicates that both hemispheres are involved in positive and negative expression perception the inclusion of older adults and the welldefined chronicity range of the braindamaged participants may have moderated these findings participant sex and general face perception ability did not influence performance furthermore while the rbd group was less accurate than the led group when the identification task tested two emotions performance of the two groups was indistinguishable when the number of emotions increased four or six this suggests that task demand moderates a study's ability to find hemispheric differences in the perception of facial emotion c 2014 elsevier inc all rights reserved
1phenyl2 pyrrolidin1yl octan1one pv9 and 16 metabolites including diastereomers and conjugates were identified or tentatively detected in human urine by gas chromatographymass spectrometry and liquid chromatographyhighresolution tandem mass spectrometry these urinary metabolites indicated that the metabolic pathways of pv9 include: 1 the reduction of ketone groups to their corresponding alcohols; 2 oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring to the corresponding pyrrolidone; 3 aliphatic oxidation of the terminal carbon atom to the corresponding carboxylate form possibly through an alcohol intermediate not detected ; and 4 hydroxylation at the penultimate carbon atom to the corresponding alcohols followed by further oxidation to ketones and combinations of these steps in addition results from the quantitative analyses of five phasei metabolites using newly synthesized authentic standards suggested that the main metabolic pathway includes the aliphatic oxidation of terminal and/or penultimate carbons human metabolism of pv9 differed significantly from those of alphapyrrolidinovalerophenone and alphapyrrolidinobutiophenone suggesting that the main metabolic pathways of alphapyrrolidinophenones significantly change depending on the alkyl chain length of the parent molecule
there has been sustained interest from both environmental regulators and livestock associations to expand the use of anaerobic digester ad technology to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions however the generally profitable practice of codigesting offfarm organic waste could increase nitrogen and phosphorus content to the farm and exacerbate nutrient overapplication concerns near large animal operations we examine the economic feasibility of a broad set of dairy waste management systems composed of two technology groups that mitigate air and water pollution: an ad system that includes either animal waste input or combination animal/offfarm organic waste codigestion input and either compressed natural gas cng or combined heat and power chp output; and a filtration system that includes fiber separation nutrient separation and/or water recovery we conclude that ad setups without codigestion are only economically feasible under limited conditions but scenarios which use codigestion have the potential to contribute to nutrient overapplication without nutrient separation technology trends for cng and chp match closely net present value npv is greatest for ad with cng scenarios estimated npv for ad with cng and environmental credits is $18 million and $397 million for dairies with 1600 and 15 000 wet cow equivalents respectively for these firm sizes the addition of codigestion contributes $48 million and $473 million respectively to estimated npv nutrient separation and water recovery both lead to decreases in scenario npv with codigestion but with the right policies dairy owners may be willing to adopt ad with nutrient separation published by elsevier ltd
this study was to assess the porosity of porous asphalt concrete pac in conjunction with a medical xray computed tomography ct facility the pac was designed as the surface course to achieve the target porosity 18% there were graded aggregates soils blended with 50% of coarse sand and crushed gravel wrapped with geotextile compacted and served as the base subbase and infiltration layers underneath the pac the test site constructed in 2004 is located in northern of taiwan in which the daily traffic has been light and limited the porosity of the test track was investigated the permeability coefficient of pac was found severely degraded from 22x10 1 to 12x10 3 cm/sec after nineyear service while the permeability below the surface course remained intact several field pac cores were drilled and brought to evaluate the distribution of air voids by a medical xray ct nondestructively the helical mode was set to administrate the xray ct scan and two crosssectional virtual slices were exported in seconds for analyzing air voids distribution it shows that the clogging of voids occurred merely 20mm below the surface and the porosity can reduce as much about 3% it was also found that the roller compaction can decrease the porosity by 4% the permeability reduction in this test site can attribute to the voids of pac that were compacted by roller during the construction and filled by the dusts on the surface during the service

purpose of reviewprimary cilia have become important organelles implicated in embryonic development organogenesis health and diseases although many studies in cell biology have focused on changes in ciliary length or ciliogenesis the most common readout for evaluating ciliary function is intracellular calciumrecent findingsrecent tools have allowed us to examine intracellular calcium in more precise locations that is the cilioplasm and cytoplasm advances in calcium imaging have also allowed us to identify which cilia respond to particular stimuli furthermore direct electrophysiological measurement of ionic currents within a cilium has provided a wealth of information for understanding the sensory roles of primary ciliasummarycalcium imaging and direct measurement of calcium currents demonstrate that primary cilia are sensory organelles that house several types of functional calcium channels although intracellular calcium now allows a functional readout for primary cilia discussions on the relative contributions of the several channel types have just begun perhaps all of these calcium channels are required and necessary to differentiate stimuli in different microenvironments

for the association analysis of wholegenome sequencing wgs studies we propose an efficient and fast spatialclustering algorithm compared to existing analysis approaches for wgs data that define the tested regions either by sliding or consecutive windows of fixed sizes along variants a meaningful grouping of nearby variants into consecutive regions has the advantage that compared to sliding window approaches the number of tested regions is likely to be smaller in comparison to consecutive fixedwindow approaches our approach is likely to group nearby variants together given existing biological evidence that diseaseassociated mutations tend to physically cluster in specific regions along the chromosome the identification of meaningful groups of nearby located variants could thus lead to a potential power gain for association analysis our algorithm defines consecutive genomic regions based on the physical positions of the variants assuming an inhomogeneous poisson process and groups together nearby variants as parameters are estimated locally the algorithm takes the differing variant density along the chromosome into account and provides locally optimal partitioning of variants into consecutive regions an rimplementation of the algorithm is provided we discuss the theoretical advances of our algorithm compared to existing windowbased approaches and show the performance and advantage of our introduced algorithm in a simulation study and by an application to alzheimer's disease wgs data our analysis identifies a region in the itgb3 gene that potentially harbors disease susceptibility loci for alzheimer's disease the regionbased association signal of itgb3 replicates in an independent data set and achieves formally genomewide significance software implementation: an implementation of the algorithm in r is available at:

joint gaze behavior plays a crucial role in nonverbal communication and enhances group interactions we recently reported that under conditions of uncertainty observers assume that another person's left/right averted gaze is directed towards them a prior for direct gaze given that people's gaze can deviate in many directions during social interactions we developed a versatile method to examine how the influence of the prior for direct gaze varies across a range of gaze directions in both forward facing and rotated heads we find that observers tend to report another's gaze along all axes as being more direct when uncertainty is introduced by adding noise to the stimulus we also find that the influence of the prior is stronger in rotated heads than direct forward heads this is consistent with the idea that when uncertain humans tend to judge gaze deviations as being directed at them regardless of head rotation or axis of deviation
two principal types of human in vivo studies with nonpharmaceuticals can be distinguished: 1 human metabolism studies are used for identification of target metabolites which can subsequently be used in biological monitoring studies furthermore they allow extrapolation from excretion of metabolite s to exposure to the parent compound on the basis of an understanding of human pharmacokinetics ? pharmacodynamic or effect studies are restricted to the study of acute and inherently reversible changes and are most likely to improve risk assessment in the following areas: neurobehavioural effects eg alcohol organic solvents alterations in biochemical markers eg cholinesterase inhibition following organophosphate exposure and topical effects eg skin irritancy ethical considerations al e of prime importance and as a minimum any human study must comply with the principles of the declaration of helsinki the protocol should include scientifically sound objectives a justification of subject numbers a formal riskbenefit analysis and provisions for appropriate ethical review the welfare of the individual participating in the study must be paramount informed consent has to be obtained and subjects must be free to withdraw from the study at any time compensation should be given for the inconvenience of participating in the study but never for undergoing risk provided these conditions are met human volunteer studies can be a powerful tool in risk assessment and risk management of exposure to nonpharmaceutical products c 2001 elsevier science ireland ltd all rights reserved

background: increasing age is the biggest risk factor for dementia of which alzheimer's disease is the commonest cause the pathological changes underpinning alzheimer's disease are thought to develop at least a decade prior to the onset of symptoms molecular positron emission tomography and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging allow key pathological processes underpinning cognitive impairment including aamyloid depostion vascular disease network breakdown and atrophy to be assessed repeatedly and noninvasively this enables potential determinants of dementia to be delineated earlier and therefore opens a presymptomatic window where intervention may prevent the onset of cognitive symptoms methods/design: this paper outlines the clinical cognitive and imaging protocol of insight 46 a neuroscience substudy of the mrc national survey of health and development this is one of the oldest british birth cohort studies and has followed 5362 individuals since their birth in england scotland and wales during one week in march 1946 these individuals have been tracked in 24 waves of data collection incorporating a wide range of health and functional measures including repeat measures of cognitive function now aged 71 years a small fraction have overt dementia but estimates suggest that similar to 1/3 of individuals in this age group may be in the preclinical stages of alzheimer's disease insight 46 is recruiting 500 study members selected at random from those who attended a clinical visit at 6064 years and on whom relevant lifecourse data are available we describe the substudy design and protocol which involves a prospective two timepoint 0 24 month data collection covering clinical neuropsychological betaamyloid positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging biomarker and genetic information data collection started in 2015 age 69 and aims to be completed in 2019 age 73 discussion: through the integration of data on the socioeconomic environment and on physical psychological and cognitive function from 0 to 69 years coupled with genetics structural and molecular imaging and intensive cognitive and neurological phenotyping insight 46 aims to identify lifetime factors which influence brain health and cognitive ageing with particular focus on alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease this will provide an evidence base for the rational design of diseasemodifying trials
the methods described herein for activation of naive cd4 + t cells in suspension and their adherence in coverslips for confocal microscopy analysis allow the spatial localization and visualization of gangliosides involved in cd4 + t cell activation that complement expression profiling experiments such as flow cytometry western blotting or realtime pcr the quantification of ganglioside expression through flow cytometry and their cellular localization through microscopy can be obtained by the use of antiganglioside antibodies with high affinity and specificity nonetheless an adequate handling of cells in suspension involves the treatment of culture plates to promote the necessary adherence required for fluorescence or confocal microscopy acquisition in this work we describe a protocol for determining gd3 and gd2 ganglioside expression and colocalization with the tcr during naive cd4 + t cell activation also realtime pcr experiments using < 40 000 cells are described for the determination of the gd3 and gm2/gd2 synthase genes demonstrating that gene analysis experiments can be performed with a low number of cells and without the need of additional low input rna kits
the anterior cingulate cortex acc has been implicated in different aspects of cognition and decision making including social cognition several studies suggest that this region is actually formed by subregions concerned with distinct cognitive functions the acc is usually divided in its rostrocaudal axis with the caudal acc playing a major role in processing own actions and the rostral acc being related to social cognition recently it has been suggested that the acc can also be functionally divided in its dorsoventral axis into acc gyrus accg and acc sulcus accs with the accg having a central role in processing social information in this context we propose that the pregenual accg might be especially important for engaging in social interactions we discuss previous findings that support this hypothesis and present evidence suggesting that the activity of pregenual accg neurons is modulated during spontaneous social interactions

a polyhedral mesh generation from standard tessellation language stl models is presented for the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem the stl format is widely used in 3d printing and computeraided design cad systems to describe the surface geometry of a 3d object an stl model for visualisation usually has flaws and is incompatible with mesh generators developed for the finite element method fem such as those found in abaqus ansys etc in this paper we combine an octreebased polyhedral mesh generation with the sbfem to perform automatic stress analyses of stl models as the sbfem has the capability to model an arbitrary polyhedron by discretising its boundary only the mesh generation effort is significantly reduced the basic idea of the proposed method is first creating an octree grid that encloses an stl model and then trimming the grid by the stl surface the trimming process follows a bottomup scheme starting from the edges faces to cells within the same framework a recovery method for sharp features is also developed it can reconstruct hard edges and points when they are required to be explicitly represented in a mesh numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
in the present study we have tested whether mri t1 relaxation time is a sensitive marker to detect early stages of amyloidosis and gliosis in the young 5xfad transgenic mouse a wellestablished animal model for alzheimer's disease 5xfad and wildtype mice were imaged in a 47 t varian horizontal bore mri system to generate t1 quantitative maps using the spinecho multislice sequence following immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein iba1 and amyloidbeta t1 and area fraction of staining were quantified in the posterior parietal and primary somatosensory cortex and corpus callosum in comparison with agematched wildtype mice we observed first signs of amyloidosis in 25monthold 5xfad mice and development of gliosis in 5monthold 5xfad mice in contrast mri t1 relaxation times of young ie 25 and 5monthold 5xfad mice were not significantly different to those of agematched wildtype controls furthermore although disease progression was detectable by increased amyloidbeta load in the brain of 5monthold 5xfad mice compared with 25monthold 5xfad mice mri t1 relaxation time did not change in summary our data suggest that mri t1 relaxation time is neither a sensitive measure of disease onset nor progression at early stages in the 5xfad mouse transgenic mouse model

introduction: preeclampsia pe is a lifethreatening pregnancy disorder characterized by widespread endothelial dysfunction placental factors circulating in the maternal blood are believed to cause endothelial dysfunction our previous study identified htra4 as a placentaspecific serine protease that is released into the maternal circulation and significantly increased in earlyonset pe in this study we examined the impact of htra4 on expression of endothelial genes related to vessel biology using human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvecs as a model methods: huvecs were treated with 0 or 3 mu g/ml htra4 highest concentration seen in pe circulation for 24 h and analysed by an endothelial cell biology pcr array containing 84 genes htra4induced changes were then validated by realtime rtpcr and elisa for time and dose dependency results: high levels of htra4 significantly altered the expression of a range of genes related to inflammation vasoactivity angiogenesis cell adhesion platelet activation and coagulation in particular pro inflammatory genes 1l6 ptgs2 cox2 and mb were significantly increased by htra4 il6 protein in huvec media was also drastically increased thbd an anticoagulant factor reported to be increased in pe was significantly upregulated by htra4 in contrast thbs1 which is involved in many regulatory processes of endothelial cell biology was severely downregulated by htra4 discussion: htra4 significantly increased the inflammatory responses of huvecs and altered their expression of a number of genes important for vessel biology these data suggest that placentaderived htra4 that is increased in pe circulation is a potential causal factor of endothelial dysfunction c 2016 the authors published by elsevier ltd
a growing body of research suggests that social contextual factors such as desires and goals affective states and stereotypes can shape early perceptual processes we suggest that a generative bayesian approach towards perception provides a powerful theoretical framework to accommodate how such highlevel social factors can influence lowlevel perceptual processes in their earliest stages we review experimental findings that show how social factors shape the perception and evaluation of people behaviour and socially relevant objects or information subsequently we summarize the generative view of perception within the `bayesian brain' and show how such a framework can account for the pervasive effects of topdown social knowledge on social cognition finally we sketch the theoretical and experimental implications of social predictive perception indicating new directions for research on the effects and neurocognitive underpinnings of social cognition c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
how can researchers use race as they do now to conduct healthcare studies when its very definition is in question? the belief that race is a social construct without biological authenticity'' though widely shared across disciplines in social science is not subscribed to by traditional science yet with an interdisciplinary approach the two horns of the social construct/genetics dilemma of race are not mutually exclusive we can use traditional science to provide a rigorous framework and use a socialscience approach so that invisible'' factors are used to adjust the design of studies on an asneeded basis one approach is to first observe healthcare outcomes and then categorize the outcomes thus removing genetic differences as racial proxies from the design of the study from the outcomes we can then determine if there is a pattern of conceivable racial categories if needed we can apply dynamic notions of race to acknowledge bias without prejudice we can use them constructively to improve outcomes and reduce racial disparities another approach is nearly identical but considers race not at all: while analyzing outcomes we can determine if there are biological differences significant enough to identify classifications of humans that is we look for genetic patterns in the outcomes and classify only those patterns there is no attempt to link those patterns to race
patients with superior canal dehiscence scd suffer from events of dizziness and vertigo in response to sound also known as tullio phenomenon tp the present work seeks to explain the fluiddynamical mechanisms behind tp in accordance with the socalled third window theory we developed a computational model for the vestibular signal pathway between stapes and scd it is based on first principles and accounts for fluidstructure interactions arising between endolymph perilymph and membranous labyrinth the simulation results reveal a wave propagation phenomenon in the membranous canal leading to two flow phenomena within the endolymph which are in close interaction first the periodic deformation of the membranous labyrinth causes oscillating endolymph flow which forces the cupula to oscillate in phase with the sound stimulus second these primary oscillations of the endolymph induce a steady flow component by a phenomenon known as steady streaming we find that this steady flow of the endolymph is typically in ampullofugal direction this flow leads to a quasisteady deflection of the cupula which increases until the driving forces of the steady streaming are balanced by the elastic reaction forces of the cupula such that the cupula attains a constant deflection amplitude which lasts as long as the sound stimulus both response types have been observed in the literature in a sensitivity study we obtain an analytical fit which very well matches our simulation results in a relevant parameter range finally we correlate the corresponding eye response vestibuloocular reflex with the fluid dynamics by a simplified model of lumped system constants the results reveal a sweet spot for tp within the audible sound spectrum we find that the underlying mechanisms which lead to tp originate primarily from reynolds stresses in the fluid which are weaker at lower sound frequencies
exoskeleton robots are categorized as rehabilitating and assisting robots which could be applied in other applications such as power augmentation systems haptic systems and virtual reality considering the increasing number of old people and those who suffer from physical weakness and some kinds of disabilities the need of exploiting the rehabilitation mechanisms and processes is one of the most important issues in this field in this paper a simple upper limb exoskeleton with one degree of freedom is studied and developed the joint torque estimation corresponding to the biological movements as well as safety issues are considered kinematic parameters of the upper limb are needed to design the robot thus a mechanism is designed to derive this set of data then a prototype of the exoskeleton is introduced whose mechanical design actuation and power transmission method as well as its selection criteria are discussed here the mechanical design section is followed by electrical circuits and devices finally the performance of robot is evaluated using a testrig mechanism which examines how the kinematical parameters of arm could be tracked by our approach
one of the hypotheses about the pathogenesis of posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd is the dysfunction of serotonin 5ht neurotransmission while certain 5ht receptor subtypes are likely critical for the symptoms of ptsd few studies have examined the role of 5ht3 receptor in the development of ptsd even though 5ht3 receptor is critical for contextual fear extinction and anxietylike behavior therefore we hypothesized that stimulation of 5ht3 receptor in the dorsal hippocampus dh could prevent hippocampal autophagy and the development of ptsdlike behavior in animals to this end we infused sr57227 selective 5ht3 agonist into the dh after a single prolonged stress sps treatment in rats three weeks later we evaluated the effects of this pharmacological treatment on anxietyrelated behaviors and extinction of contextual fear memory we also accessed hippocampal autophagy and the expression of 5ht3a subunit beclin1 lc3i and lc3ii in the dh we found that sps treatment did not alter anxietyrelated behaviors but prolonged the extinction of contextual fear memory and such a behavioral phenomenon was correlated with increased hippocampal autophagy decreased 5ht3a expression and increased expression of beclin1 and lc3ii/lc3i ratio in the dh furthermore intradh infusions of sr57227 dosedependently promoted the extinction of contextual fear memory prevented hippocampal autophagy and decreased expression of beclin1 and lc3ii/lc3i ratio in the dh these results indicated that 5ht3 receptor in the hippocampus may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of hippocampal autophagy and is likely involved in the pathophysiology of ptsd
objective the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of radiographic spinal progression and disease activity on function and spinal mobility in patients with ankylosing spondylitis as treated with tumor necrosis factoralpha tnfalpha inhibitors for up to 10 years methods patients with as who participated in 2 longterm openlabel extensions of clinical trials with tnfalpha inhibitors 43 receiving infliximab and 17 receiving etanercept were included in this analysis based on the availability of spinal radiographs performed at baseline and at a later timepoint yr 2 4 6 8 and 10 during followup spinal radiographs were scored according to the modified stoke ankylosing spondylitis spine score msasss function was assessed by the bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index basfi spinal mobility by the bath ankylosing spondylitis metrology index basmi and disease activity by the bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index basdai results after the initial improvement basfi and basmi remained remarkably stable at low levels over up to 10 years despite radiographic spinal progression in the generalized mixed effects model analysis no association between the msasss and the basfi change beta 00 95% ci 003 to 003 was found while there was some effect of msasss changes on basmi changes over time beta 005 95% ci 001009 basdai showed a strong association with function beta 064 95% ci 054073 and to a lesser extent with spinal mobility beta 014 95% ci 001026 conclusion functional status and spinal mobility of patients with established as remained stable during longterm antitnfalpha therapy despite radiographic progression this indicates that reduction and continuous control of inflammation might be able to outweigh the functional effect of structural damage progression in as
narcissism can lead to various interpersonal problems however the characteristics of social decision making in trait narcissism and the cognitive and affective underpinnings are poorly understood we employed established game theoretical paradigms to investigate different facets of social behavior in participants n 122; 41 female mean age 30 years with a wide range of scores on the pathological narcissistic inventory interpersonal traits attitudes and emotions were assessed as potential mediators of behavioral differences high narcissism scores were related to lower generosity especially when this could result in being punished this maladaptive behavior was fully mediated by reduced perspectivetaking abilities in narcissism also narcissism scores predicted higher levels of punishment behavior driven by higher levels of experienced anger hence the difficulties narcissists face in interactions may be due to their reduced perspectivetaking skills and resulting reduced generosity as well as enhanced angerbased retaliation behavior c 2016 published by elsevier ltd

while cryptography is used to protect the content of information eg a message by making it undecipherable behaviors as opposed to information may not be encrypted and may only be protected by partially or fully hiding through creation of ambiguity by providing covers that generate indistinguishable observations from secrets having a cover together with partial observability does cause ambiguity about the system behaviors desired to be kept secret yet some information about secrets may still be leaked due to statistical difference between the occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers in this paper we propose a jensenshannon divergence jsd based measure to quantify secrecy loss in systems modeled as partially observed stochastic discrete event systems which quantifies the statistical difference between two distributions one over the observations generated by secret and the other over those generated by cover we further show that the proposed jsd measure for secrecy loss is equivalent to the mutual information between the distributions over possible observations and that over possible system status secret versus cover since an adversary is likely to discriminate more if he/she observes for a longer period our goal is to evaluate the worst case loss of secrecy as obtained in the limit over longer and longer observations computation for the proposed measure is also presented illustrative examples including the one with sidechannel attack are provided to demonstrate the proposed computation approach note to practitionerssecrecy is the ability to hide private information for communicated information this can be done through encryption or access control however the same is not possible for system behaviors and in contrast cover is introduced for providing ambiguity quantifying the ability to hide secrets is a challenge this paper provides a means to quantify this in terms of a type of distance measure between a secret and its cover a computation of the same is also provided for partially observed stochastic discrete event systems and illustrated through a cache's sidechannel secrecy loss example
wind power is a clean and renewable resource and it is rapidly becoming an important component of sustainable development and resource transfer however the construction of wind farms impacts the environment and has been the subject of considerable research in this study we verified whether china's gf2 hd satellite gf2 could be used to monitor the 10 million kilowatt wind power grassland construction area in jiuquan city gansu province monitoring was performed by comparing the imaging results from the landsat 8 oli and china's gf1 hd satellite gf1 we performed an interactive interpretation of the remote sensing images and verified the accuracy of these interpretations using measured field data we evaluated 354 pieces of wind turbine equipment with an average construction density of 031 km 2 per device the construction of a single wind turbine was found to damage nearly 3000 m 2 of grassland the average area of grassland damaged by 3 mw and 15 mw turbines was 5757 m 2 and 2496 m 2 respectively approximately 244 km 2 of farmland was occupied by wind power construction and accounted for approximately 22% of the study area roads covered 606% of the farmland occupied by wind power construction the average difference between the measured and calculated gf2 image data was 009 and the overall interpretation accuracy was approximately 84% therefore the use of comprehensive imaging analyses and gf2 image data are feasible for monitoring grasslands under construction for wind power in addition the impacts of wind farm construction on vegetation destruction and soil erosion are discussed in this study grassland wind farms are explored using remote sensing tools to guide decision making with regards to the rational use of grassland resources and their sustainable development c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved

background: one of the disadvantages of the zirconia implants is the lack of elasticity which is increased with the use of ceramic or zirconia crowns the consequences that could result from this lack of elasticity have led to the search for new materials with improved mechanical properties case presentation: a patient who is a 45yearold woman nonsmoker and has no medical record of interest with a longitudinal fracture in the palatal root of molar tooth 17 and absence of tooth 16 was selected in order to receive a zirconia implant with a peekbased restoration and a composite coating the following case report describes and analyses treatment with zirconia implants in molars following a flapless surgical technique zirconia implants are an alternative to titanium implants in patients with allergies or who are sensitive to metal alloys however one of the disadvantages that they have is their lack of elasticity which increases with the use of ceramic or zirconia crowns the consequences that can arise from this lack of elasticity have led to the search for new materials with better mechanical properties to cushion occlusal loads peekbased restoration in implant prosthetics can compensate these occlusal forces facilitating cushioning while chewing conclusion: this procedure provides excellent elasticity and resembles natural tooth structure this clinical case suggests that peek restorations can be used in zirconia implants in dentistry
inflammatory joint disease ijd is a group of conditions that target the joints and periarticular structures the contribution of genetic factors to these conditions is often less than 50% suggesting a major role for environmental influences twin studies are the best means of assessing the role for genetic factors in ijd conclusive evidence has been provided by a few studies in vast samples of monozygotic and dizygotic twins with only one twin in each pair having ijd these studies have been most successful in ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis the other ijds have proven more difficult to evaluate this review demonstrates that genetic and environmental factors are inextricably linked and that ascribing ijds to one or the other is misguided awareness of the limitations and possible sources of bias in twin studies is important when seeking to understand the development of these complex diseases c 2016 published by elsevier masson sas on behalf of societe francaise de rhumatologie
this paper introduces a comparative study on the design of aerospace actuators concerning induction motor and permanentmagnet motor technologies in the analysis undertaken the two candidate configurations are evaluated in terms of both their electromagnetic and thermal behaviors in a combined manner on a first step the basic dimensioning of the actuators and their fundamental operational characteristics are determined via a timestepping finiteelement analysis the consideration of the thermal robustness of the proposed motor configurations is integrated in the design procedure through the appropriate handling of their respective constraints as a result all comparisons are carried out on a common thermal evacuation basis on a second step a single objective optimization procedure is employed considering several performance and efficiency indexes using appropriate weights manufacturing and constructionrelated costs for both investigated topologies are considered by employing specific penalty functions the impact of the utilized materials is also examined the resultant motor designs have been validated through manufactured prototypes illustrating their suitability for aerospace actuation
since the publication of premack and woodruff's classic paper introducing the notion of a 'theory of mind' premack and woodruff in behav brain sci 1 4 :515526 1978 interdisciplinary research in social cognition has witnessed the development of theorytheory simulation theory hybrid approaches and most recently interactionist and perceptual accounts of other minds the challenges that these various approaches present for each other and for research in social cognition range from adequately defining central concepts to designing experimental paradigms for testing empirical hypotheses but is there any approach that promises to dominate future interdisciplinary research in social cognition? is social cognition witnessing a gradual paradigm shift where hitherto grounding notions such as theory of mind are no longer viewed as explanatorily necessary? or have we simply lost our way in attempting to devise adequate experimental setups that could sway the debate in favour of one of the contending accounts? this special issue addresses these questions in an attempt to discover what the future holds for interdisciplinary research in social cognition
in this paper a single current sensor technique scst is proposed for singlephase fullbridge inverters the proposed scst measures the currents of multiple branches at the same time and reconstructs the average inductor capacitor and load current in a single switching cycle since all of the branches' current in the lc filter and the load are obtained using the scst both the inductor and the capacitor current feedback schemes can be selectively applied while taking advantages of each other this paper also analyzes both of the current feedback schemes from the view point of the closedloop output impedance the proposed scst and the analysis in this paper are verified through experiments on a 3kva singlephase uninterruptible power supply ups
the hypoxiainducible factor hif family of transcription factors directs a coordinated cellular response to hypoxia that includes the transcriptional regulation of a number of metabolic enzymes chuvash polycythemia cp is an autosomal recessive human disorder in which the regulatory degradation of hif is impaired resulting in elevated levels of hif at normal oxygen tensions apart from the polycythemia cp patients have marked abnormalities of cardiopulmonary function no studies of integrated metabolic function have been reported here we describe the response of these patients to a series of metabolic stresses: exercise of a large muscle mass on a cycle ergometer exercise of a small muscle mass calf muscle which allowed noninvasive in vivo assessments of muscle metabolism using 31 p magnetic resonance spectroscopy and a standard meal tolerance test during exercise cp patients had early and marked phosphocreatine depletion and acidosis in skeletal muscle greater accumulation of lactate in blood and reduced maximum exercise capacities muscle biopsy specimens from cp patients showed elevated levels of transcript for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase phosphofructokinase and muscle pyruvate kinase in cell culture a range of experimental manipulations have been used to study the effects of hif on cellular metabolism however these approaches provide no potential to investigate integrated responses at the level of the whole organism although cp is relatively subtle disorder our study now reveals a striking regulatory role for hif on metabolism during exercise in humans these findings have significant implications for the development of therapeutic approaches targeting the hif pathway
characterised by the increased spread of technology out of workplaces and into public spaces and homes the socalled thirdwave of humancomputer interaction has placed greater focus on scenarios that are socially situated context dependent and not necessarily task oriented this movement has led to studies investigating how people interact with digital applications in public spaces but the discussion of intuitive interaction thus far has not been extended to this new realm of user interfaces designing for intuitive interaction in public spaces differs from traditional digital applications due to the inherently fluid social nature and often largescale character of urban interventions this article discusses the design of interaction for public spaces based on applications we developed along the years contrasted to similar endeavours elsewhere we analyse them through the lens of frameworks for intuitive interactions and derive a series of strategies towards designing for immediate use and high crowd turnaround in urban interventions

we are assessing the effect of our new freshman electrical engineering course sequence on followon courses one of our assessments is a survey distributed to sophomores in electrical circuits and juniors in microelectronics courses roughly one half of freshman year is spent on programming in matlab and c and problem solving using these programming tools our observation is that students consider programming important and have reasonably good confidence selfefficacy that they can solve problems using matlab and c however when asked about frequency of use for these tools students report using them somewhere between once a week and once a month there is a significant number of students who report almost no usage at all results are consistent across sophomore and junior years with a slight uptick in frequency of use for juniors we are hypothesizing that students do not view matlab and c as tools for problem solving but as yet another item to acquire in their studies our plan is to change instruction in sophomore courses so that more problemsolving which requires programming will be introduced the existing survey will be used to measure future improvement
in sensornode applications the auxiliary power is drawn from the ac mains to supply the mixedsignal sensor components there is therefore a need for lowcost sub1w miniature nonisolated acdc downconverters in this work a new twochip architecture is proposed to implement a highvoltage quasiresonant buck converter with peak currentmode control the current and voltage control loops are implemented in the highside hs and lowside ls ic respectively each ic includes a 700v power transistor sensing and control circuits the ls ic transmits the digital peak current command along with mode selection information to the hs ic using a lowpower 20 mhz isolated communication interface the architecture achieves a peak simulated efficiency of 856% when converting from 339 v to 12 v and allows the size of the input filter to be greatly reduced due to the currentmode operation stateofthe art uhv bcd technologies offer a unique opportunity to increase the level of integration and reduce the system cost in the targeted sensor node applications despite the relatively poor figureofmerit of the hv devices compared to discrete silicon superjunction or gan alternatives
twitter spam has become a critical problem nowadays recent works focus on applying machine learning techniques for twitter spam detection which make use of the statistical features of tweets in our labeled tweets data set however we observe that the statistical properties of spam tweets vary over time and thus the performance of existing machine learningbased classifiers decreases this issue is referred to as twitter spam drift in order to tackle this problem we first carry out a deep analysis on the statistical features of one million spam tweets and one million nonspam tweets and then propose a novel lfun scheme the proposed scheme can discover changed spam tweets from unlabeled tweets and incorporate them into classifier's training process a number of experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed scheme the results show that our proposed lfun scheme can significantly improve the spam detection accuracy in realworld scenarios

this crosscultural study examines first whether 18montholds' helping behavior differs between cultures and second the way in which caregivers' socialization goals and practices are associated with toddlers' helping behavior helping behavior was assessed in three outofreach tasks with increasing motivational demands we found that delhi toddlers n 32 helped more than munster toddlers n 60 regarding socialization practices sps delhi mothers compared with munster mothers reported to provide more opportunities to help in the family context and to praise less when fostering toddlers' prosocial behavior furthermore delhi mothers reported to use more punitive practices after their children did not follow a helping request on an intracultural level we found that helping was positively associated with punitive practices in the delhi sample whereas helping was negatively related with punitive practices and providing opportunities to help in munster on the basis of these results we first propose that culture affects toddlers' helping behavior from the time of emergence during the second year second we propose that the culturespecific conceptions of prosocial behavior influence which sps parents use which in turn may influence children's motivation underlying early prosocial behavior
the present research finds that anthropomorphism or attributing human characteristics to nonhuman objects increases consumers' preference for products with superior appearance this effect occurs because consumers apply the belief of beautiful is good a pervasive stereotype in person perception to the judgment of anthropomorphized products seven experiments test the propositions the results show that product anthropomorphism vs nonanthropomorphism leads consumers to spend more time and money searching for information about appearance attributes experiments 1 and 2 to indicate greater preference for products with superior appearance experiments 4 6 and 7 and to purchase products with superior appearance experiments 3 and 5 the experiments also show that the effect of anthropomorphism on consumer preference is mediated by consumers' conviction of beautiful is good in person perception this effect is alleviated when consumers' beliefs about the association between the attractive physical appearance of a person and the positive personal traits of this person are challenged these results are robust across a wide range of product categories and consumers theoretical contributions and marketing implications are discussed

this paper presents a power electronic converter used to redistribute the power among the phases in unbalanced power systems which is supposed to be designed based on the involved degree of unbalance a bidirectional converter is chosen for this purpose whose modeling is presented in the dq0 system this solution can be considered as part of a unified control system where conventional active power filters may be solely responsible for compensating harmonics and/or the tuning of passive filters becomes easier with consequent reduction in involved costs in a decentralized approach the adopted control strategy is implemented in digital signal processor tms320f2812 while experimental results obtained from an experimental prototype rated at 1786 kva are properly discussed considering that the converter is placed at the secondary side of a transformer supplying three distinct singlephase loads it is effectively shown that the converter is able to balance the currents in the transformer phases thus leading to the suppression of the neutral current
opisthorchis viverrini is a major public health concern in southeast asia various reports have suggested that this parasite may represent a species complex with genetic structure in the region perhaps being dictated by geographical factors and different species of intermediate hosts we used four microsatellite loci to analyze o viverrini adult worms originating from six species of cyprinid fish in thailand and lao pdr two distinct o viverrini populations were observed in ban phai thailand only one subgroup occurred hosted by two different fish species both subgroups occurred in fish from that luang lao pdr but were represented to very different degrees among the fish hosts there our data suggest that although geographical separation is more important than fish host specificity in influencing genetic structure it is possible that two species of opisthorchis with little interbreeding are present near vientiane in lao pdr

the waterenergy nexus has been increasingly studied in order to elucidate the complex interdependence between water and energy resources and as a result enhance management practices to conserve both resources alike in this context integrated water management plans have direct implications on the energy embodied into water and sewerage services the objective of this study is to assess the potential for energy savings in water and sewerage services by means of onsite integrated water and sewage management strategies in lowincome households in florianopolis brazil the studied water efficient measures include: i installation of water efficient fixtures dual flush toilets and water efficient taps ; ii reclamation of grey water from shower washing basin and laundry for toilet flushing; and iii rainwater use for laundry and toilet flushing from the combination of these measures the water and energy saving potential of seven integrated water and sewage management strategies were studied moreover the water consumption pattern at ten lowincome households with conventional and water efficient taps were empirically determined using water smart meters; whereas the rainwater supply capacity was estimated by using the computer programme netuno 40 and the grey water supply and sewage reduction capacities were determined using model equations rainwater harvesting alone appeared as the least favourable strategy for energy savings as the energy consumption would increase 4% compared to a centralised system; while the combination of water efficient fixtures and grey water reclamation gave rise to the greatest energy saving potential 48% the findings of this study indicate that from an energy management point of view the sustainability of the water sector is primarily associated with the reduction of effluents to centralised systems rather than the use of alternative water sources c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
existing methods of measuring loop gain of digitally controlled dc/dc converters mainly fall into two categories namely the analog signal disturbance method asdm and the digital signal disturbance method dsdm however the loop gains obtained from these methods do not totally agree with each other through rigorous theoretical analysis this paper has derived the expressions of openloop gains obtained from these two methods whose accuracy has been verified by simulation also this paper has put forward that the difference in signal that enters into the sampler results in the variation of the transfer function of the sampler and further induces the difference between the openloop gains obtained from the asdm and the dsdm
background antibiotic use in early life has been linked to disruptions in the microbiome such changes can disturb immune system development differences have been observed in the microbiota of children with and without allergies but there have been few studies on antibiotic use and allergic disease objective we evaluated associations of earlylife antibiotic use with subsequent occurrence of food allergy and other allergies in childhood using electronic health record data methods we used longitudinal data on 30 060 children up to age 7 years from geisinger clinic's electronic health record to conduct a sex and agematched casecontrol study to evaluate the association between antibiotic use and milk allergy nonmilk food allergies and other allergies for each outcome we estimated conditional logistic regression models adjusting for race/ethnicity history of medical assistance and mode of birth delivery models were repeated separately for penicillins cephalosporins and macrolides results there were 484 milk allergy cases 598 nonmilk food allergy cases and 3652 other allergy cases children with three or more antibiotic orders had a greater odds of milk allergy odds ratio; 95% confidence interval 178; 128248 nonmilk food allergy 165; 127214 and other allergies 307; 272346 compared with children with no antibiotic orders associations were strongest at younger ages and differed by antibiotic class conclusions and clinical relevance we observed associations between antibiotic orders and allergic diseases providing evidence of a potentially modifiable clinical practice associated with paediatric allergic disease differences by antibiotic class should be further explored as this knowledge could inform paediatric treatment decisions

mental illness and substance use are overrepresented within urban homeless populations this paper compared substance use patterns between homeless individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum ss and bipolar disorders bd using the miniinternational neuropsychiatric interview from a sample of 497 subjects drawn from vancouver canada who participated in the at home/ chez soi study 146 and 94 homeless individuals were identified as bd and ss respectively in the previous 12 months a greater proportion of bd homeless reported greater use of cocaine chi 2 200 p 0000 amphetamines chi 2 13 8 p 0000 opiates chi 2 246 p 0000 hallucinogens chi 2 117 p 0000 cannabinoids chi 2 505 p 0034 and tranquilizers chi 2 795 p 0004 compared to ss cocaine and opiates were significantly associated with bd homeless chi 2 3906 df 2 p < 0000 the present study illustrates the relationship between substance use and bd in a vulnerable urban population of homeless affected by adverse psychosocial factors and severe psychiatric conditions
language is an important part of our culture and allows the exchange of thoughts and feelings as well as the acquisition of knowledge deficits in language abilities can appear at different linguistic levels phonetics/phonology lexicon/semantics syntax/morphology and pragmatics this can concern both language comprehension and speech production in different ways the different linguistic levels should be considered in the diagnosis of developmental language disorders in particular the german guidelines interdisziplinare s2kleitlinie support this approach this paper gives an overview of the symptoms of specific language disorder as well as its classification in the dsm5 and the icd10 moreover there is an outlook toward the icd11 with explanations based on the betadraft the similarities and differences of the three diagnostic systems are pointed out and discussed furthermore reference is made to the interdisziplinare s2kleitlinie while there is a distinction between expressive and receptive language disorders in the icd10 in the dsm5 the two disorders are summarized in one clinical picture in the current icd11 betadraft the disorders are still divided; however they are subordinate to a common category this represents a compromise between the two approaches additionally the dsm5 is supplemented by the diagnosis of social pragmatic communication disorder and it is likely that the disorder will be included in the icd11 developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly pragmatic language too the disorder is characterized by deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication future research should consider pragmatic aspects of language the overview shows that there are no uniform diagnostic criteria furthermore none of the illustrated systems considered the individual linguistic level of language as is suggested in the interdisziplinare s2kleitlinie although the icfcy also cannot capture all the linguistic levels it enables a comprehensive description of impairments and abilities in the differential diagnosis a mental retardation must be excluded by nonverbal intelligence diagnosis this is controversial because it is difficult to implement in logopedics practice and speech therapy moreover in the diagnosis of specific language disorders the double discrepancy criterion must be scrutinized in the current interdisziplinare s2kleitlinie this criterion was waived because of the controversy in practice the different definitions and classifications of specific language disorders lead to significant variations in the data on prevalence additionally the causal research and effectiveness tests of therapeutic interventions are complicated moreover for a long period there was no uniform standard in the design of assessments for diagnosis the reliable diagnosis of language developmental disorders requires a comprehensive interdisciplinary classification
theorists and researchers have noted an overlap between individuals who are bisexuallyidentified and queeridentified although early definitions of bisexuality may have been predominantly binary ie attracted to women and men in recent years there has been a move toward a more queer understanding of bisexuality eg attraction to more than one gender beyond women and men the purpose of this study was to examine similarities and differences between adult women who were bisexuallyidentified and those who were queeridentified ages 18 to 66 years on sociodemographic characteristics two dimensions of sexual orientation sexual behaviors and attractions fluidity in attractions and sexual orientation identity and identity centrality and affirmation in an online sample n 489 which was mostly from the united states 735% results indicated that women who are bisexual and queer were similar in terms of sociodemographic characteristics with the exception of education; women identifying as queer were more educated than women identifying as bisexual women identifying as queer were also more likely than women identifying as bisexual to report variability in their sexual behaviors and attractions and more fluidity in their sexual orientation identity additionally women identifying as queer reported higher levels of identity centrality and affirmation than women identifying as bisexual considerations for sexual minority women's health research are discussed

research on bullying has highlighted the role of morality in explaining the different behavior of students during bullying episodes however the research has been limited to the analysis of explicit measures of moral characteristics and moral reasoning whereas implicit measures have yet to be fully considered to overcome this limitation this study investigated the association between bullying and defending on one hand and both explicit moral disengagement selfimportance of moral values and implicit immediate affect toward moral stimuli iams moral components on the other hand young adolescents n 279 mean age 11 years 9 months 444% girls completed a series of selfreport scales and individually performed a computer task investigating the iams two hierarchical regressions bootstrapping method were performed results showed that moral disengagement was associated with bullying and defending behavior at high levels of iams however not when iams was low in contrast selfimportance of moral values was not significantly associated to the two behaviors when iams was high whereas both associations were significant at low levels of iams these results significantly expand previous knowledge about the role of morality in bullying and defending behavior in particular they highlight the role of the interaction between explicit and implicit moral dimensions in predicting bullying and defending behaviors c 2016 society for the study of school psychology published by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
this paper shows how a method developed by van steenwijk can be generalized to calculate the resistance between any two vertices of a symmetrical polytope all of whose edges are identical resistors the method is applied to a number of structures that have not been considered earlier such as the archimedean polyhedra and their duals in three dimensions the regular polytopes in four dimensions and the hypercube in any number of dimensions
objective: questionnaires are often used to assess the results of nasal septoplasty but response rates vary widely the possible bias caused by nonresponders was evaluated to determine the validity of questionnaire results methods: postoperative questionnaires employing visual analogue scales for nasal obstruction were mailed to 182 patients the 62 nonresponders 341 per cent were contacted by telephone 58 935 per cent of whom were contactable and responded orally to the questionnaire results: nonresponders were younger but no different from responders with regard to gender smoking habits or allergies postoperative visual analogue scale obstruction scores were slightly but not statistically higher in nonresponders however because nonresponders' preoperative scores were lower obstruction scores improved less than in responders the main reason for not responding was forgetfulness some would have preferred an electronic version of the questionnaire conclusion: although postoperative obstruction scores did not differ between the groups nasal obstruction scores improved more among responders than nonresponders thus low response rates may cause bias
galactose metabolism in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is carried out by a specialized gal pathway consisting of structural and regulatory proteins it is known that cells with unbalanced gal proteins accumulate toxic metabolic intermediates and exhibit severe growth defects recently we found that the molecular chaperone hsp90 controls the abundance of multiple gal proteins possibly to prevent these defects hsp90 regulates various cellular processes including cell morphology in response to environmental cues yeast cells are known to resort to filamentous growth upon exposure to galactose or other environmental stresses our previous and current findings support the hsp90 titration model of hsp90 buffering which links the cell morphology and galactose pathways our results suggest that when a large proportion of hsp90 molecules are used to help gal proteins the hsp90 client proteins in cell morphology pathways are left unattended leading to filamentous growth it remains unclear whether this phenomenon serves any biological function or simply reflects a cellular constraint nonetheless it provides an alternative explanation why the gal pathway is degenerated in some yeast species

land subsidence caused by mining activities is an example of human transformation of the natural environment and leads to changes in land use the study covers an area of 958 ha in the silesian upland southern poland records from the period 18901990 document the presence of subsidence effects in 829% of the study area and the maximum displacement figure is more than 30m which translates to an average rate of 03m per year it was found that subsidence basins serve as the new local erosion base and new sedimentation basins they are filled with sediments whose level of pollution ranges from moderate to heavy and extremely heavy subsidence has caused a dramatic change in the local hydrology including the quality and quantity of the water the specifics involve: the emergence of new closed drainage catchments with a total area of 6511 ha; an increase in the total watercourse length from 09 to 57 km ; an increase in the river network density from 009 to 056 km km 2 ; a decrease in the number from 81 to 48 and an increase in the area from 238 to 584 ha of lakes and ponds; an increase in the lake coverage ratio from 25% to 61% and in water pollution subsidence has limited the potential land uses which led to a decrease in arable land from 6190 to 1225 ha that gave way to other land uses including those equivalent to wasteland copyright c 2016 john wiley & sons ltd
the processing of cassava has relied mainly on equipment used for other crops in most developing countries also there is a dearth of information regarding the engineering properties of cassava root and its products some selected engineering properties of ` oko iyawo' tme7 a popular cassava cultivar in southwestern nigeria were studied the study focused on some physical properties of cassava root which include mass dimensions peel thickness and peel proportion by weight ppw also studied were the frictional properties of stainless steel galvanized sheets and wooden surfaces at a moisture content range of 040060 g h2o/g of wet mass which is necessary information required in machine design for processing equipment fifty freshly harvested cassava roots selected at random were used the mass length diameters and peel thicknesses at the head middle and tail ranged respectively from 641480 g 110500 mm 1570 175760 and 125670 mm and 1550 1359 and 1159 mm while the ppw ranged from 12803813% respectively the coefficient of internal friction cif ranged from 056061 over the range of moisture content studied the coefficient of rolling resistance crr obtained using the periderm cortex and flesh against the three surfaces were 015 023 and 029; 012 020 and 024; and 007 013 and 018 respectively while the coefficient of friction cof ranged from 018025 037048 and 057070 on stainless steel galvanized sheets and wood surfaces respectively over the range of moisture contents studied the influence of moisture content on the coefficients of friction and internal friction as well as on the periderm cortex and flesh on the three surfaces were significant p< 005 an oval root shape was established all this is useful information for the development of more efficient cassava processing handling and harvesting machines
induced earthquakes often accompany fluid injection and the seismic hazard they pose threatens various underground engineering projects models to monitor and control induced seismic hazard with traffic light systems should be probabilistic forwardlooking and updated as new data arrive in this study we propose an induced seismicity test bench to test and rank such models; this test bench can be used for model development model selection and ensemble model building we apply the test bench to data from the basel 2006 and soultzsousforets 2004 geothermal stimulation projects and we assess forecasts from two models: shapiro and smoothed seismicity sass and hydraulics and seismics hysei these models incorporate a different mix of physicsbased elements and stochastic representation of the induced sequences our results show that neither model is fully superior to the other generally hysei forecasts the seismicity rate better after shutin but is only mediocre at forecasting the spatial distribution on the other hand sass forecasts the spatial distribution better and gives better seismicity rate estimates before shutin the shutin phase is a difficult moment for both models in both reservoirs: the models tend to underpredict the seismicity rate around and shortly after shutin
purpose: increased bodymassindex bmi has been associated with brain atrophy in both gray and white matter structures however little is known concerning the integrity of white matter tracts in obesity the purpose of the study was to evaluate the pattern of changes in white matter microstructure in human adiposity material and methods: the study included 268 participants 52 obese 96 overweight and 120 normalweight that were retrospectively evaluated by diffusion tensor imaging the fractional anisotropy axial radial and mean diffusivity values were compared between the above groups using tract based spatial statistics results: the analysis revealed that the increased bmi was related with decreased fractional anisotropy in several white matter regions including the anterior and posterior thalamic radiation the inferior frontooccipital fasciculus the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus the corpus callosum callosal body and forceps minor the uncinate fasciculus the internal capsule the corticospinal tract and the cingulum cingulate gyrus and hippocampus conclusions: anisotropic diffusion of anatomic regions governing important brain circuits such as reward seeking inhibition motivation/drive and learning/conditioning decreases with increasing bmi c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
in the past decade the power of harnessing tcell cosignaling pathways has become increasingly understood to have significant clinical importance in cancer immunotherapy the field has concentrated on two related modalities: first targeting cancer antigens through highly activated chimeric antigen t cells carts and second reanimating endogenous quiescent t cells through checkpoint blockade in each of these strategies the therapeutic goal is to reignite tcell immunity in order to eradicate tumors in transplantation there is also great interest in targeting tcell cosignaling but with the opposite goal: in this field we seek the yin to cancer immunotherapy's yang and focus on manipulating tcell cosignaling to induce tolerance rather than activation in this review we discuss the major tcell signaling pathways that are being investigated for tolerance induction detailing preclinical studies and the path to the clinic for many of these molecules these include blockade of costimulation pathways and agonism of coinhibitory pathways in order to achieve the delicate state of balance that is transplant tolerance: a state which guarantees lifelong transplant acceptance without ongoing immunosuppression and with preservation of protective immune responses in the context of the clinical translation of immune tolerance strategies we discuss the significant challenge that is embodied by the fact that targeted pathway modulators may have opposing effects on tolerance based on their impact on effector vs regulatory tcell biology achieving this delicate balance holds the key to the major challenge of transplantation: lifelong control of alloreactivity while maintaining an otherwise intact immune system
this experiment manipulated elite endurance cyclists' implicit beliefs about the nature of decisionmaking ability and explored subsequent change in performance on a decisionmaking task under submaximal physiological load in total 54 elitelevel endurance cyclists 10 women and 44 men were manipulated to endorse a limited susceptible to depletion or nonlimited unsusceptible to depletion implicit belief about decisionmaking ability results showed that after the manipulation cyclists assigned to the limited resource condition had higher levels of limited beliefs and lower levels of nonlimited beliefs than those assigned to the nonlimited resource condition those in the limited resource condition also showed a decrease in decisionmaking performance whereas those in the nonlimited resource condition showed an increase in decisionmaking performance findings suggest that implicit beliefs about decisionmaking ability can be manipulated in an elite sport sample and that such manipulation can alter performance on a decisionmaking task under submaximal physiological load

a host of mining practices produce finegrained mineral sludge such as mature fine tailing from oilsand extraction these sludges are hard to dewater because of their high clay content and their low hydraulic conductivity this paper describes pressure filtration tests in which eight different nonwoven geotextiles gtxs were used to filter highclaycontent sludges the sludges were formulated by mixing kaolinite and silt to obtain eight different grainsize distributions gsds with d 50 ranging from 3 to 55 mu m and clay content ranging from 0% to 38% d < 2 mu m the sludges created for this research had the gsd and variability of real fine tailings the results indicate that sludges can be filtered with nonwoven gtxs selected on the basis of their poreopening size furthermore calendered gtxs are more efficient in retaining particles than needle punched gtxs in addition only during the early stage of filtration do gtxs really influence filtering because it is at this stage that by retaining coarser particles they allow progressive formation of filter cake upon forming the filter cake becomes the major contributor to particle retention finally the sludge composition is found to be the most significant factor affecting the final state of dewatering c 2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
human prosocial behavior emerges in the 2nd year of life posing challenging questions about mechanism an increasingly common claim is that prosocial behavior in the first 3 years of life is neither a result of nor affected by socialization in this article we argue that early socialization plays a critical role in the developmental origins of prosocial behavior to support this argument we highlight conceptual perspectives and empirical evidence for influences of socialization from parents' reports direct observation and experimental studies we conclude that progress in explaining the ontogenetic origins of human prosocial behavior depends on more fully specifying mechanisms of socialization in infancy as well as what and how human infants learn from their social experiences
the treatment of craniofacial defects can present many challenges due to the variety of tissuespecific requirements and the complexity of anatomical structures in that region 3dprinting technologies provide clinicians engineers and scientists with the ability to create patientspecific solutions for craniofacial defects currently there are three key strategies that utilize these technologies to restore both appearance and function to patients: rehabilitation reconstruction and regeneration in rehabilitation 3dprinting can be used to create prostheses to replace or cover damaged tissues reconstruction through plastic surgery can also leverage 3dprinting technologies to create custom cutting guides fixation devices practice models and implanted medical devices to improve patient outcomes regeneration of tissue attempts to replace defects with biological materials 3dprinting can be used to create either scaffolds or living cellular constructs to signal tissueforming cells to regenerate defect regions by integrating these three approaches 3dprinting technologies afford the opportunity to develop personalized treatment plans and designdriven manufacturing solutions to improve aesthetic and functional outcomes for patients with craniofacial defects
psychotic disorders are some of the most severe psychiatric conditions patients have difficulties in identifying facial expressions and appear to be highly sensitive to the presence of emotional distractors yet no study has investigated whether perceptual load modulates the interference of emotional distractors our goal was to test whether psychotic patients were more sensitive to irrelevant emotional stimulus even when the task demands a high amount of attentional resources twentytwo participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and twentytwo healthy controls performed a target letter discrimination task with emotional taskirrelevant stimulus angry happy and neutral facial expressions targetletters were presented among distratorletters which could be similar low perceptual load or different high load ; participants should discriminate the targetletter and ignore the facial expression results showed that patients were more prone to distraction by taskirrelevant stimulus especially under high load suggesting difficulties in attention control moreover in psychotic patients happy faces caused higher interference with the task whereas neutral and angry faces resulted in less interference these findings could provide innovative approaches regarding attentional deficits on social contexts in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders

we assessed whether diversity in plant hydraulic traits can explain the observed diversity in plant responses to water stress in seasonally dry tropical forests sdtfs the ecosystem demography model 2 ed2 was updated with a traitdriven mechanistic plant hydraulic module as well as novel droughtphenology and plant water stress schemes four plant functional types were parameterized on the basis of metaanalysis of plant hydraulic traits simulations from both the original and the updated ed2 were evaluated against 5yr of field data from a costa rican sdtf site and remotesensing data over central america the updated model generated realistic plant hydraulic dynamics such as leaf water potential and stem sap flow compared with the original ed2 predictions from our novel traitdriven model matched better with observed growth phenology and their variations among functional groups most notably the original ed2 produced unrealistically small leaf area index lai and underestimated cumulative leaf litter both of these biases were corrected by the updated model the updated model was also better able to simulate spatial patterns of lai dynamics in central america plant hydraulic traits are intercorrelated in sdtfs mechanistic incorporation of plant hydraulic traits is necessary for the simulation of spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation dynamics in sdtfs in vegetation models
nanovesicles similar to 100 nm are ubiquitous in cell biology and an important vector for drug delivery mechanical properties of vesicles are known to influence cellular uptake but the mechanism by which deformation dynamics affect internalization is poorly understood this is partly due to the fact that experimental studies of the mechanics of such vesicles remain challenging particularly at the nanometer scale where appropriate theoretical models have also been lacking here we probe the mechanical properties of nanoscale liposomes using atomic force microscopy afm indentation the mechanical response of the nanovesicles shows initial linear behavior and subsequent flattening corresponding to inward tether formation we derive a quantitative model including the competing effects of internal pressure and membrane bending that corresponds well to these experimental observations our results are consistent with a bending modulus of the lipid bilayer of similar to 14k b t surprisingly we find that vesicle stiffness is pressure dominated for adherent vesicles under physiological conditions our experimental method and quantitative theory represents a robust approach to study the mechanics of nanoscale vesicles which are abundant in biology as well as being of interest for the rational design of liposomal vectors for drug delivery

subjects with mild cognitive impairment mci have an increased risk of developing alzheimer's disease ad and their functional brain networks are presumably already altered to test this hypothesis we compared magnetoencephalography meg eyesclosed restingstate recordings from 29 mci subjects and 29 healthy elderly subjects in the present exploratory study functional connectivity in different frequency bands was assessed with the phase lag index pli in source space normalized weighted clustering coefficient normalized cw and path length normalized lw as well as network measures derived from the minimum spanning tree mst; ie betweenness centrality bc and node degree were calculated first we found altered pli values in the lower and upper alpha bands in mci patients compared to controls thereafter we explored network differences in these frequency bands normalized cw and lw did not differ between the groups whereas bc and node degree of the mst differed although these differences did not survive correction for multiple testing using the false discovery rate fdr as an exploratory study we may conclude that: 1 the increases and decreases observed in pli values in lower and upper alpha bands in mci patients may be interpreted as a dual pattern of disconnection and aberrant functioning; 2 network measures are in line with connectivity findings indicating a lower efficiency of the brain networks in mci patients; 3 the mst centrality measures are more sensitive to detect subtle differences in the functional brain networks in mci than traditional graph theoretical metrics

recent methods for detailed and accurate biomass and carbon stock estimation of forests have been driven by advances in remote sensing technology the conventional approach to biomass estimation heavily relies on the tree species and sitespecific allometric equations which are based on destructive methods this paper introduces a nondestructive laserbased approach terrestrial laser scanner for individual tree aboveground biomass estimation in the royal belum forest reserve perak malaysia the study area is in the state park and it is believed to be one of the oldest rainforests in the world the point clouds generated for 35 forest plots using the terrestrial laser scanner were georectified and cleaned to produce separate point clouds for individual trees the volumes of tree trunks were estimated based on a cylinder model fitted to the point clouds the biomasses of tree trunks were calculated by multiplying the volume and the species wood density the biomasses of branches and leaves were also estimated based on the estimated volume and density values branch and leaf volumes were estimated based on the fitted point clouds using an alphashape approach the estimated individual biomass and the total above ground biomass were compared with the aboveground biomass agb value estimated using existing allometric equations and individual tree census data collected in the field the results show that the combination of a simple singletree stem reconstruction and wood density can be used to estimate stem biomass comparable to the results usually obtained through existing allometric equations however there are several issues associated with the data and method used for branch and leaf biomass estimations which need further improvement
in this paper we describe a second order multidimensional scheme belonging to the class of direct arbitrary lagrangianeulerian ale methods for the solution of nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation law the scheme is constructed upon a cellcentered explicit lagrangian solver completed with an edgebased upwinded formulation of the numerical fluxes computed from the musclhancock method to obtain a full ale formulation numerical fluxes depend on nodal grid velocities which are either set or computed to avoid most of the mesh problems typically encountered in purely lagrangian simulations in order to assess the robustness of the scheme most results proposed in this paper have been obtained by computing the grid velocities as a fraction of the lagrangian nodal velocities the ratio being set before running the test case the last part of the paper describes preliminary results about the triple point test case run in the ale framework by computing the grid velocities with the fully adaptive large eddy limitation lel method proposed in 1 such a method automatically computes the grid velocities at each node defining the mesh from the local characteristics of the flow we eventually discuss the advantages and the drawback of the coupling c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
decomposed granite roadcuts are difficult to revegetate after losing the topsoil and vegetation cover we developed a new drilling machine digger to efficiently drill six holes simultaneously on decomposed granite roadcuts to facilitate revegetation the digger consists of a base machine 07m 3 level excavator and a mounting body with six hydraulic motors instead of a bucket we tested its performance on two roadcuts in southwest korea using timemotion studies which showed that the digger can drill 240m 2 of decomposed granite roadcuts daily the unit cost of the digger was less than a half of other roadcut stabilization and revegetation techniques in korea making the digger a costeffective revegetation technology field germination and growth tests were also conducted to identify appropriate diameter and depth of drilling holes suitable revegetation species and mulching treatment we drilled holes with three different diameters and depths filled the holes with a mixture of plant seeds and cultivated soil applied mulching treatments coir geotextile shade net and no mulching and measured the germination and growth results at two field plots after 1month and 1year the results showed that drilling diameter 10cm and depth 10cm were large enough to result in better plant germination and growth erosion control species poa pratensis l and eragrostis curvula schrad nees survived and grew better than native woody species coir geotextile improved the plant germination and growth the timemotion and revegetation results show that the digger can be a promising technology to restore decomposed granite roadcuts copyright c 2013 john wiley & sons ltd

the fair exchange of resources provides a basis for developing morality yet research has rarely examined the role of group processes that are central to children's world in this article we describe a new perspective as well as research demonstrating that group processes play a key role in the fair allocation of resources among children and adolescents we contend that when children allocate resources group processes and moral judgments are relevant a developmental shift occurs in children's ability to coordinate moral and group concerns and group processes contribute to intergroup bias regarding allocations but also to efforts to consider the status of disadvantaged groups our perspective informs efforts to reduce prejudice as well as increase fairness and equality in situations in which group processes are relevant for allocating resources fairly

in highvelocity chute flows freesurface aeration is often observed the phenomenon is called selfaeration or white waters when the turbulent shear stresses next to the freesurface are large enough air bubbles are entrained throughout the entire airwater column a rapidlyvaried flow region is observed immediately downstream of the inception point of freesurface aeration an analytical solution of the air diffusion equation is proposed and the results compare well with new experimental data both experiments and theory indicate that the flow bulking spans over approximately 34 step cavities downstream of the inception point of freesurface aeration on a stepped chute further downstream the void fraction distributions follow closely earlier solutions of the air diffusion equation the application of the diffusion equation solution to prototype and laboratory data shows air bubble diffusivities typically larger than the momentum transfer coefficient the result highlights however a marked decrease in the ratio of air bubble diffusivity to eddy viscosity with increasing reynolds number the finding might indicate some limitation of laboratory investigations of air bubble diffusion process in selfaerated flows and of their extrapolation to fullscale prototype applications

to advance the investigation of vegetated terrain using polarimetric remote sensing techniques it is important to determine the electromagnetic properties of key constituents such as branches and trunks which may be realistically modeled by tapered cylinders to this end we apply our previously proposed virtual partition method vpm numerical simulations demonstrate that vpm possesses the desired features such as high fidelity prediction of the scattering amplitude function and fulfillment of energy conservation as well as the reciprocity theorem it thus may be helpful in the pursuit of better coherent scattering models of vegetated terrain a finer understanding of polinsar imagery and a better characterization of scattering mechanisms
the domain name system dns is a core internet infrastructure that translates names to machinereadable information such as ip addresses security flaws in dns led to a major overhaul with the introduction of the dns security dnssec extensions dnssec adds integrity and authenticity to the dns using digital signatures dnssec however has its own concerns it suffers from availability problems due to packet fragmentation and is a potent source of distributed denialofservice attacks in earlier work we argued that many issues with dnssec stem from the choice of rsa as default signature algorithm a switch to alternatives based on elliptic curve cryptography ecc can resolve these issues yet switching to ecc introduces a new problem: ecc signature validation is much slower than rsa validation thus switching dnssec to ecc imposes a significant additional burden on dns resolvers pushing load toward the edges of the network therefore in this paper we study the question: will switching dnssec to ecc lead to problems for dns resolvers or can they handle the extra load? to answer this question we developed a model that accurately predicts how many signature validations dns resolvers have to perform this allows us to calculate the additional cpu load ecc imposes on a resolver using realworld measurements from four dns resolvers and with two opensource dns implementations we evaluate future scenarios where dnssec is universally deployed our results conclusively show that switching dnssec to ecc signature schemes does not impose an insurmountable load on dns resolvers even in worst case scenarios
in this paper we analyze and discuss the wellposedness of two new variants of the socalled sweeping process introduced by moreau in the early 70s moreau in s m anal convexe montpellier 1971 with motivation in plasticity theory the first new variant is concerned with the perturbation of the normal cone to the moving convex subset supposed to have a bounded variation by a lipschitz mapping under some assumptions on the data we show that the perturbed differential measure inclusion has one and only one right continuous solution with bounded variation the second variant for which a large analysis is made concerns a first order sweeping process with velocity in the moving set this class of problems subsumes as a particular case the evolution variational inequalities widely used in applied mathematics and unilateral mechanics duvaut and lions in inequalities in mechanics and physics springer berlin 1976 assuming that the moving subset has a continuous variation for every with bounded we show that the problem has at least a lipschitz continuous solution the wellposedness of this class of sweeping process is obtained under the coercivity assumption of the involved operator we also discuss some applications of the sweeping process to the study of vector hysteresis operators in the elastoplastic model kreja +/ in eur j appl math 2:281292 1991 to the planning procedure in mathematical economy henry in j math anal appl 41:179186 1973 and cornet in j math anal appl 96:130147 1983 and to nonregular electrical circuits containing nonsmooth electronic devices like diodes acary et al nonsmooth modeling and simulation for switched circuits lecture notes in electrical engineering springer new york 2011 the theoretical results are supported by some numerical simulations to prove the efficiency of the algorithm used in the existence proof our methodology is based only on tools from convex analysis like other papers in this collection we show in this presentation how elegant modern convex analysis was influenced by moreau's seminal work

populationgenomic analyses are essential to understanding factors shaping genomic variation and lineagespecific sequence constraints the dearth of such analyses for unicellular eukaryotes prompted us to assess genomic variation in paramecium one of the most wellstudied ciliate genera the paramecium aurelia complex consists of similar to 15 morphologically indistinguishable species that diverged subsequent to two rounds of wholegenome duplications wgds as long as 320 mya and possess extremely streamlined genomes we examine patterns of both nuclear and mitochondrial polymorphism by sequencing whole genomes of 1013 worldwide isolates of each of three species belonging to the p aurelia complex: p tetraurelia p biaurelia p sexaurelia as well as two outgroup species that do not share the wgds: p caudatum and p multimicronucleatum an apparent absence of global geographic population structure suggests continuous or recent dispersal of paramecium over long distances intergenic regions are highly constrained relative to coding sequences especially in p caudatum and p multimicronucleatum that have shorter intergenic distances sequence diversity and divergence are reduced up to similar to 100150 bp both upstream and downstream of genes suggesting strong constraints imposed by the presence of densely packed regulatory modules in addition comparison of sequence variation at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites suggests similar recent selective pressures on paralogs within and orthologs across the deeply diverging species this study presents the first genomewide populationgenomic analysis in ciliates and provides a valuable resource for future studies in evolutionary and functional genetics in paramecium
although singlecenter and crosssectional studies have suggested a modest impact of liver donation on donor psychological wellbeing few studies have assessed these outcomes prospectively among a large cohort we conducted one of the largest prospective multicenter studies of psychological outcomes in living liver donors within the adulttoadult living donor liver transplantation cohort study2 a2all2 consortium in total 271 91% of 297 eligible donors were interviewed at least once before donation and at 3 6 12 and 24 mo after donation using validated measures we found that living liver donors reported low rates of major depressive 03% alcohol abuse 25% and anxiety syndromes 23% at any given assessment in their first 2 years after donation between 47% and 96% of donors reported impaired mental wellbeing at various time points we identified significant predictors for donors' perceptions of being better people and experiencing psychological growth following donation including age sex relationship to recipient ambivalence and motivation regarding donation and feeling that donation would make life more worthwhile our results highlight the need for close psychosocial monitoring for those donors whose recipients died n27 ; some of those donors experienced guilt and concerns about responsibility careful screening and targeted datadriven followup hold promise for optimizing psychological outcomes following this procedure for potentially vulnerable donors a prospective study of living liver donors across nine transplant centers shows low rates of major depressive alcohol abuse and anxiety syndromes though some donors such as those whose recipients die may benefit from close psychosocial monitoring

this paper refers to recovering waste heat from the hot gases exhausted by internal combustion engines ices driving electric generators egs at full and partial load the topic is of particular interest for developing countries where electric grids are underdeveloped or missing and electricity is generated locally by using classical fuels the heat recovery system is based on an organic rankine cycle orc a novel method is proposed for the optimum design of orcbased systems operating in combination with ice at partial eg loads first orcbased systems coupled with ices operating at full eg load is treated specific results for the operation at full eg load are as follows: i the optimum superheating increment ranges between 30 and 40 degrees c depending on the type of the working fluids; ii a pinch point temperature difference exits between the flue gas temperature and the working fluid at the evaporator inlet; iii the total area of the evaporator is very close to the total area of the condenser a fact which facilitates manufacturing; iv the surface area of the preheater zone is about 75% of the total surface area while those of the boiler zone and superheater zone is about 135% and 115% respectively second the case of the orcbased systems coupled with ices operating at partial eg load is considered specific results for this case are as follows: v the net power may be maximized by optimizing the working fluid mass flow rate; vi when the ice is coupled with an orcbased system the overall thermal efficiency of the combined system eta iceorc is higher than the thermal efficiency of the ice operating alone as an example for the case treated here 'eta iceorc is higher than hits by 600% 585% and 591% for eg loads of 100% 75% and 50% respectively c 2017 elsevier ltd
ultraviolet spectrophotometry has been widely applied in determination of water quality parameters because of its advantagous properties compared to chemical method such as high efficiency easy operation and nonsecondary pollutions nitrate nitrogen is one of major pollutants in waste water the standard ultraviolet spectrophotometry used to determinate the concentration of nitrate nitrogen in water is firstly to determinate the absorbances at wavelength 220 and 275 nm which is used to calibrate the former followed by the plotting of standard curve while the linear equation described by lambertbeer's law and the linearity in the superposition of absorbances of various substance on which the standard ultraviolet spectrophotometry based are not fitted well anymore with the increase of concentration in addition it was found to be difficult to construct absorption model of nitrate solution at wavelength 220 nm in experiment to overcome the disadvantages in singlewavelength or doublewavalengths spectrophotometry the absorbances at the wavelength that covered by the absorption peak are introduced into the construction of the model and to avoid the increase of the model complexification resulted by the introduction of more wavelengths we run the principal components analysis on the original absorbances data the data with dimensions compressed from 107 down to 4 after process construct the absorbance model using locally weighted linear regression good performance were achieved in both training samples set and test samples set using this model and it was able to deal with the nonlinear relation between the absorbance and concentration thus raised the upper range limit concentrations of nitrate nitrogen up to hundreds mg l1 from 4 mg l1 defined in the standard method meanwhile the principle and procedure of this analytical method are suitable for the absorbance model construction of other solutions
digital audio signal provides a large capacity for embedding hidden messages using digital steganography techniques how to prevent hazardous steganography embedding on the internet becomes an important task in the field of network security for the internet environment the steganography attack method is required to be generic and real time an active wardenbased attack method is potential to be a generic method for the steganography attack a discrete spring transform dst based generic active warden steganography attack framework has been proposed by us in this paper based on the dst a realtime steganography attack method is proposed the potential unauthorized hidden message is removed in a realtime manner when uploading or downloading the audio signal the realtime signal perceptual quality control is achieved by the automatic feedback from the objective audio quality evaluation model the attack parameters are adaptively changed to reach a balance between the attack performance and the audio signal quality the simulation results validate the proposed method in terms of the steganography attack performance and the audio signal quality after the attack copyright c 2014 john wiley & sons ltd
background: most countries have started to educate students with special educational needs sen in mainstream schools but it remains unclear how inclusive attitudes towards students with sen can be promoted aims: this study investigated the role of adolescents' friendships and sociomoral competencies for their attitudes towards the inclusion of students with sen specifically we studied whether adolescents without sen would develop more inclusive attitudes if they had close friendships with sen students and if they expressed negative emotions about social exclusion methods: adolescents' inclusive attitudes and their emotions were gathered from survey data of 1225 swiss students aged 1113 social network data were collected to assess adolescents' friendship relationships results: the results indicated that adolescents' friendship closeness with sen students positively related to their inclusive attitudes however this was only true for adolescents who anticipated more negative than positive emotions if a student with sen was excluded implications: these findings highlight the role of friendship relationships between adolescents with and without sen and adolescents' sociomoral experiences for their attitudes towards the inclusion of peers with sen thus inclusive education may benefit from promoting friendships among students with and without sen as well as adolescents' sociomoral competencies c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

vehicular network has been recently used to achieve high efficient and flexible traffic scheduling at intersection roads for smart transportation systems different from existing works where traffic signal is used to schedule waiting vehicles at each lane we propose to divide vehicles in the same lane into small groups and schedule vehicle groups via wireless communication rather than traffic lights such direct scheduling of vehicles can reduce waiting time and improve fairness especially when the traffic volume in different lanes is imbalanced the key challenge in such a design lies in determining appropriate size of groups with respect to realtime traffic conditions to cope with this issue we propose a neurofuzzy networkbased grouping mechanism where the network is trained using reinforcement learning technique also vehicle groups are scheduled via a neurofuzzy network simulations using ns3 are conducted to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and compare it with similar works the results show that our algorithm can reduce waiting time and at the same time improve fairness in various cases and the advantage against traffic light algorithms can be up to 40%

prior to 1950 the consensus was that biological transformations occurred in twoelectron steps thereby avoiding the generation of free radicals dramatic advances in spectroscopy biochemistry and molecular biology have led to the realization that proteinbased radicals participate in a vast array of vital biological mechanisms redox processes involving highpotential intermediates formed in reactions with o2 are particularly susceptible to radical formation clusters of tyrosine tyr and tryptophan trp residues have been found in many o2reactive enzymes raising the possibility that they play an antioxidant protective role in blue copper proteins with plastocyaninlike domains tyr/trp clusters are uncommon in the lowpotential singledomain electrontransfer proteins and in the twodomain copper nitrite reductases the twodomain muticopper oxidases however exhibit clusters of tyr and trp residues near the trinuclear copper active site where o2 is reduced these clusters may play a protective role to ensure that reactive oxygen species are not liberated during o2 reduction

understanding the discharge capacity of channels and changes in hydraulic properties during large storms is essential for prediction of flash floods however such information is limited for steep mountain channels because of their complex nature and the lack of measured data thus we obtained detailed waterlevel and surfacevelocity data during large floods of a steep mountain channel and documented how complex channel morphology affected water flow during large storms we installed waterlevel and surfacevelocity sensors at a cascade and at a pool that was 10 m downstream at the aono research forest of the arboricultural research institute of the university of tokyo forests in japan we successfully obtained 1min interval data for a major storm with total precipitation of 288 mm that fell over 59 h and a maximum rainfall intensity of 25 mm/h during the storm height of the water surface from the deepest point of each cross section ranged from 035 to 157 m and surface velocity ranged from 035 to 415 m/s as expected the changes in flow depth surface velocity and velocity profiles were complex and differed even between the cascade and adjacent pool cross sections dramatic changes in flow conditions first occurred at the cascade when discharge increased to a certain point when water suddenly stagnated at the foot of the cascade and submerged flow might have occurred thereafter the water level increased remarkably but surface velocity and the velocity profile stayed almost constant at the cascade cross section at the downstream pool where most rocks were submerged at a mean water depth of 07 m surface velocity suddenly increased dramatically and the velocity profile changed as very slow flow developed in the lower portion of the profile while water levels increased only slightly when the rainfall diminished first the surface velocity markedly declined then the velocity profile returned to its original state at the pool and then submerged flow at the bottom of the cascade ceased these temporally and spatially detailed flow measurements effectively document and characterize flow conditions during a large flood in a steep mountain channel these field data confirm the long held hypothesis that marked changes in flow conditions occur when steps become submerged c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved

there is a common belief that wrinkles in the aging face reflect frequently experienced emotions and hence resemble these affective displays this implies that the wrinkles and folds in elderly faces interfere with the perception of other emotions currently experienced by the elderly as well as with the inferences perceivers draw from these expressions whereas there is ample research on the impact of aging on emotion recognition almost no research has focused on how emotions expressed by the elderly are perceived by others the present research addresses this latter question young participants rated the emotion expressions and behavioral intentions of old and young faces displaying identical expressions the findings suggest that emotions shown on older faces have reduced signal clarity and may consequently have less impact on inferences regarding behavioral intentions both effects can be expected to have negative consequences for rapport achieved in everyday interactions involving the elderly c 2012 elsevier inc all rights reserved

in this study we describe the construction of the first genetically modified mutant of a halovirus infecting haloalkaliphilic archaea by random choice we targeted orf79 a currently uncharacterized viral gene of the haloalkaliphilic virus phi ch1 we used a polyethylene glycol peg mediated transformation method to deliver a disruption cassette into a lysogenic strain of the haloalkaliphilic archaeon natrialba magadii bearing phi ch1 as a provirus this approach yielded mutant virus particles carrying a disrupted version of orf79 disruption of orf79 did not influence morphology of the mature virions the mutant virus was able to infect cured strains of n magadii resulting in a lysogenic orf79disrupted strain analysis of this strain carrying the mutant virus revealed a repressor function of orf79 in the absence of gp79 onset of lysis and expression of viral proteins occurred prematurely compared to their timing in the wildtype strain constitutive expression of orf79 in a cured strain of n magadii reduced the plating efficiency of phi ch1 by seven orders of magnitude overexpression of orf79 in a lysogenic strain of n magadii resulted in an inhibition of lysis and total absence of viral proteins as well as viral progeny in further experiments gp79 directly regulated the expression of the tail fiber protein orf34 but did not influence the methyltransferase gene orf94 further we describe the establishment of an inducible promoter for in vivo studies in n magadii importance genetic analyses of haloalkaliphilic archaea or haloviruses are only rarely reported therefore only little insight into the in vivo roles of proteins and their functions has been gained so far we used a reverse genetics approach to identify the function of a yet undescribed gene of phi ch1 we provide evidence that gp79 a currently unknown protein of phi ch1 acts as a repressor protein of the viral life cycle affecting the transition from the lysogenic to the lytic state of the virus thus repressor genes in other haloviruses could be identified by sequence homologies to gp79 in the future moreover we describe the use of an inducible promoter of n magadii our work provides valuable tools for the identification of other unknown viral genes by our approach as well as for functional studies of proteins by inducible expression
phasing genotypes to haplotypes is becoming increasingly important due to its applications in the study of diseases population and evolutionary genetics imputation and so on several studies have focused on the development of computational methods that infer haplotype phase from population genotype data the aim of this study was to compare phasing algorithms implemented in beagle findhap flmpute impute2 and shapelt2 software using 50k and 777k hd genotyping data six scenarios were considered: noparents sireprogeny pairs siredamprogeny trios each with and without pedigree information in holstein cattle algorithms were compared with respect to their phasing accuracy and computational efficiency in the studied population beagle and flmpute were more accurate than other phasing algorithms across scenarios phasing accuracies for beagle and flmpute were 99499990% and 99449999% for 50k respectively and 99909999% and 99879999% for hd respectively generally flmpute resulted in higher accuracy when genotypic information of at least one parent was available in the absence of parental genotypes and pedigree information beagle and impute2 with double the default number of states were slightly more accurate than flmpute findhap gave high phasing accuracy when parents' genotypes and pedigree information were available in terms of computing time findhap was the fastest algorithm followed by flmpute flmpute was 30 to 131 87 to 786 and 353 to 1 400 times faster across scenarios than beagle shapelt2 and impute2 respectively in summary flmpute and beagle were the most accurate phasing algorithms moreover the low computational requirement of flmpute makes it an attractive algorithm for phasing genotypes of large livestock populations
the output performance of a reluctance synchronous machine strongly depends on a welldesigned machine draft since there are many different requirements concerning the output capability the machine design has to be done considering all specifications and demands also determined by the field of application however the machine design and optimization by genetic algorithm is a simple and comparatively fast method to achieve adequate results and is therefore presented within this publication the outcome of the optimization of course depends on the algorithm provided design variables as well as the calculation model concealed behind in this case an analytical model based on a simplified magnetic circuit analysis is used for fitness value computation the calculation method provides good results regarding some major parameters like d and qaxis inductances as well as d and qaxis currents within the genetic algorithm optimization a flexible design of reluctance synchronous machines in terms of the specific requirements is easily accessible as a result important conclusions regarding the stator and rotor geometry can be achieved

the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster is one of the five sensors on the nasa's terra satellite on orbit since december 1999 aster consists of three radiometers the visible and near infrared vnir the shortwave infrared swir and thermal infrared tir whose spatial resolutions are 15 m 30 m and 90 m respectively unfortunately the swir image data are saturated since april 2008 due to the offset rise caused by the cooler temperature rise but the vnir and the tir are taking earth images of good quality the vnir and the tir experienced responsivity degradation while the swir showed little change from the lamp calibration band 1 decreased the most among three vnir bands and 31 % in thirteen years the vnir has the electrical calibration mode to check the healthiness of the electrical circuits through the charge coupled device ccd four voltage levels from line 1 to line 4 which are from 278 v to 310 v are input to the ccd in the onboard calibration sequence and the output digital numbers dns are detected in the images these input voltages are monitored as telemetry data and have been stable up to now from the electrical calibration we can check stabilities of the offset gain ratio and gain stability of the electric circuit the output level of the line1 input is close to the offset level which is measured while observing the earth at night the trend of the line 1 output is compared to the offset level they are similar but are not exactly the same the trend of the even pixel and odd pixel is the same so the saturated offset levels of the odd pixel is corrected by using the even pixel trend the gain ratio trend shows that the ratio is stable but the ratio values are different from those measured before launch the difference comes up to 10 % for the band 2 the correct gain ratio should be applied to the vicarious calibration result because the onboard calibration is measured with the normal gain whereas the vicarious calibration often measures with the high gain the cause of the vnir responsivity degradation is not known but one of the causes might be the change of the electric circuit the band 3 gain shows 16 % decrease whereas the gain changes of the band 1 and band 2 are 5 % to 8 % the responsivity decrease after 1000 days since launch might be controlled by the electric circuit change

flexible bed sills are extensively used in rivers in several applications: to protect pipeline crossings for slope control and to enhance environmental aspects use of riprap provides the flexibility required to adjust to small changes in river bed level and makes this material one of the most commonly used shear failure of riprap has been extensively studied but little knowledge is available on edge failure of flexible bed sills and on the design of the required extent of sills to protect assets experimental work in a large test facility was carried out to gain improved understanding of flat sills and sills protruding above the bed significantly lower depth and length of the scour hole were observed at the downstream edge of flat riprap sills than at rigid sills existing equations for rigid bed sills were found not to be appropriate for estimating scour at the flexible bed sills tested as expected protrusion enhances scour potential significantly: it was found that scour depths were of the order of 100% or greater than those associated with flat sills the research has provided useful evidence for avoiding placement of pipelines straight on to river beds and instead to adopt trenches whenever feasible
background: the amounts of vitamin a that are metabolically derived from specific carotenecontaining foods are largely unknown objective: we sought to develop an improved method for estimating the metabolic vitamin a potential of provitamin a carotenoids by using h2 4 retinyl acetate d 4 ra as an extrinsic reference standard design: healthy subjects consumed a standardized test meal containing 6 mg beta carotene as either raw carrot or spinach either 20 or 1 g added fat and 60 mu mol d 4 ra concentrations of unlabeled d 0 retinyl esters re labeled d 4 re and carotenoids in the plasma triacylglycerolrich lipoprotein fraction d<1006 kg/l were determined in serial blood samples with hplc and gas chromatographymass spectrometry baselinecorrected areas under the curve for d 0 re d 4 re and carotenoids were calculated and the masses of absorbed doretinol and carotenes were estimated assuming 80% absorption of the d 4 ra reference dose results: in trials with ample 20 g fat n6 74% of the 6 mg beta carotene ingested was taken up as beta carotene plus re with 03 +/01 mg as retinol test meals without carotenes yielded no beta carotene or d 0 re response and there was no effect of treatment either fat amount or vegetable n6 on the mean d 4 re area under the curve the lowerthanexpected vitamin a yields were attributed to poor intestinal uptake rather than to low conversion of beta carotene to re conclusion: the triacylglycerolrich lipoprotein and d 4 ra method which controls for variation in chylomicron kinetics in vivo and re recovery during analysis is useful for obtaining quantitative estimates of the vitamin a potential of single meals

the emergence of altruistic behavior in infants fosters their social development and supports their involvement in our society altruistic tendencies intended to benefit others with no apparent rewards are also very useful for social robots that are designed to be used in our households yet to make robots capable of learning how to help others as infants do it is important to understand the mechanisms and motives responsible for the development of altruistic behavior further understanding the mechanisms behind the early development of prosocial behavior would be a great contribution to the field of developmental psychology to these ends we hypothesize that infants from 14 months of age help others to minimize the differences between predicted actions and observations that is to minimize prediction errors to evaluate our hypothesis we created a computational model based on psychological studies and implemented it in real and simulated robots our system first acquires its own sensorymotor representation by interacting with its environment then using its experience the system recognizes and predicts others' actions and uses this prediction to estimate a prediction error our experiments demonstrated that our robots could spontaneously generate helping behaviors by being motivated by the minimization of prediction errors

stabilizing smallholder crop yields under changing climatic conditions in subsaharan africa will require adaptation strategies focused on soil and water management impact studies of climate change on crop yields often ignore the potential of adaptation strategies such as rainwater harvesting rwh while rwh is bringing benefits to agricultural systems today it is still unclear which regions could increasingly benefit from rwh under changing climatic conditions here we employ a continental scale modelling strategy using the latest cmip5 data and explicitly take into account design factors of rwh to show that it is a valuable adaptation strategy to climate change in africa for maize zea mays l we find that rwh can bridge up to 40 % of the yield gaps attributable to water deficits under current conditions and 31 % under future 2050s climatic conditions during the main growing season for maize hence providing an alternative to irrigation from scarce or inaccessible groundwater resources rwh could increase maize yields by 1450 % on average for the 2050s across africa by bridging water deficits while in situ rwh strategies show great biophysical potential as an adaptation strategy to climate change there remain locally specific barriers to their adoption which will need to be addressed to ensure their successful implementation at a larger scale
patriotism and threat have been shown to predict immigration attitudes we suggest that patriotism is influential in producing threat and such threat drives antiimmigration attitudes but this relationship is different for whites and latinos all participants completed a patriotism scale blind and constructive patriotism measures a threat scale realistic and symbolic threat and antiimmigration attitude scale latinos showed lower blind patriotism realistic threat symbolic threat and antiimmigration attitudes compared to whites with no differences in constructive patriotism threat partially mediated the relationship between blind patriotism and antiimmigration attitudes for whites and fully mediated the relationship for latinos threat partially mediated the relationship for cultural patriotism and antiimmigration attitude for whites but not for latinos implications for public policy and education concerning immigrant attitudes are discussed

humandog interaction relies to a large extent on nonverbal communication and it is therefore plausible that human sensitivity to nonverbal signals affects interactions between human and dog experience with dogs is also likely to influence humandog interactions and it has been suggested that it influences human social skills the present study investigated possible links between human nonverbal sensitivity experience with dogs and the quality of humandog interactions two studies are reported in study 1 97 veterinary students took a psychometric test assessing human nonverbal sensitivity and answered a questionnaire on their experience with dogs the data obtained were then used to investigate the relationship between experience with dogs and sensitivity to human nonverbal communication the results did not indicate that experience with dogs improves human nonverbal sensitivity in study 2 16 students with high and 15 students with low levels of human nonverbal sensitivity were selected each of the 31 students interacted once with an unknown dog in a greeting situation and these humandog interactions were videoed we found that a combined score of dog behaviors relating to insecurity was associated with the students' level of nonverbal sensitivity and experience with dogs: the dog showed more of the insecure behavior when interacting with students with a low level of nonverbal sensitivity and no experience with dogs than it did when interacting with students with a high level of nonverbal sensitivity irrespective of experience with dogs
recent experiments on the asdex upgrade tokamak aim at improving the physics base for iter and demo to aid the machine design and prepare efficient operation type i edge localized mode elm mitigation using resonant magnetic perturbations rmps has been shown at low pedestal collisionality nu * ped < 04 in contrast to the previous high nu* regime suppression only occurs in a narrow rmp spectral window indicating a resonant process and a concomitant confinement drop is observed due to a reduction of pedestal top density and electron temperature strong evidence is found for the ion heat flux to be the decisive element for the lh power threshold a physics based scaling of the density at which the minimum plh occurs indicates that iter could take advantage of it to initiate hmode at lower density than that of the final q 10 operational point core density fluctuation measurements resolved in radius and wave number show that an increase of r/lte introduced by offaxis electron cyclotron resonance heating ecrh mainly increases the large scale fluctuations the radial variation of the fluctuation level is in agreement with simulations using the gene code fast particles are shown to undergo classical slowing down in the absence of large scale magnetohydrodynamic mhd events and for low heating power but show signs of anomalous radial redistribution at large heating power consistent with a broadened offaxis neutral beam current drive current profile under these conditions neoclassical tearing mode ntm suppression experiments using electron cyclotron current drive eccd with feedback controlled deposition have allowed to test several control strategies for iter including automated control of 3 2 and 2 1 ntms during a single discharge disruption mitigation studies using massive gas injection mgi can show an increased fuelling efficiency with high field side injection but a saturation of the fuelling efficiency is observed at high injected mass as needed for runaway electron suppression large locked modes can significantly decrease the fuelling efficiency and increase the asymmetry of radiated power during mgi mitigation concerning power exhaust the partially detached iter divertor scenario has been demonstrated at psep/r 10 mw m 1 in asdex upgrade with a peak time averaged target load around 5 mw m 2 well consistent with the component limits for iter developing this towards demo full detachment was achieved at psep/r 7 mw m 1 and stationary discharges with core radiation fraction of the order of demo requirements 70% instead of the 30% needed for iter were demonstrated finally it remains difficult to establish the standard iter q 10 scenario at low q 95 3 in the alltungsten allw asdex upgrade due to the observed poor confinement at low beta n this is mainly due to a degraded pedestal performance and hence investigations at shifting the operational point to higher beta n by lowering the current have been started at higher q 95 pedestal performance can be recovered by seeding n2 as well as cd4 which is interpreted as improved pedestal stability due to the decrease of bootstrap current with increasing z eff concerning advanced scenarios the upgrade of ecrh power has allowed experiments with central ctreccd to modify the qprofile in improved hmode scenarios showing an increase in confinement at still good mhd stability with flat elevated qprofiles at values between 15 and 2

magnetic properties of silicon steel laminations are important features in power transformer and electrical machine design and manufacture conventional testing methods such as epstein frame and single sheet tester may only consider one direction or one sheet which may deviate from the real application particularly in core loss calculation a 3d magnetic properties' testing method is proposed in this paper by using the designed special surface bh sensing coils the dynamic magnetic hysteresis properties of a laminated nongrainoriented silicon steel sample are accurately measured the relationship between b and h in alternating 2d rotational and 3d spherical rotational excitations from 50 to 200 hz is studied and analyzed in order to control the b waveform better the harmonics of bx and by signals are analyzed at 50 hz the alternating core losses in the rolling transverse and laminated directions and the rotational core losses in the xoy plane of this sample at 50 100 and 200 hz are calculated and analyzed moreover the core losses in the three directions are well predicted by means of total core loss separation theory
one of the adverse effects of shrinking transistor sizes is that processors have become increasingly prone to hardware faults at the same time the number of cores per die rises consequently core failures can no longer be ruled out and future operating systems for manycore machines will have to incorporate fault tolerance mechanisms we present csr a strategy for recovery from unexpected permanent processor faults in commodity operating systems our approach overcomes surprise removal of faulty cores and also tolerates cascading core failures when a core fails in user mode csr terminates the process executing on that core and migrates the remaining processes in its runqueue to other cores we further show how hardware transactional memory may be used to overcome failures in critical kernel code our solution is scalable incurs low overhead and is designed to integrate into modern operating systems we have implemented it in the linux kernel using haswell's transactional synchronization extension and tested it on a real system
when constructing structures receiving high vertical and horizontal force such as port facilities caissons and breakwaters on a soft ground on the sea or seashore it is very important to increase the strength of the ground and inhibit excessive settlement recently there have been numerous studies on the method of wrapping the outer wall of granular piles with geotextile or geogrid that has a certain level of tensile strength since the geotextile increases the strength of granular piles by confinement effects those confined granular piles more advantages than the conventional sand compaction piles scp in terms of the bearing capacity and settlement furthermore this method consumes less aggregate compared to the conventional sand compaction pile scp or gravel compaction pile gcp method this study proposed to determine the characteristics of mechanical behaviors such as bearing capacity and stress concentration ratio of a composite ground improved using scps reinforced with geotextile geotextileencased sand pile gesp as an alternative to the conventional scp method with this purpose several loading tests were conducted on the artificially sedimented clay grounds reinforced using conventional scps and gesps with geotextiles of three different tensile strengths with various replacement ratios based on the results of this study the bearing capacity of the soft clay ground reinforced by the gesps is larger than that of the soft ground reinforced by the conventional scps and the failure mode of the gesps is buckling different from the bulging of the scps the tensile strength of the geotextile has little effect on the bearing capacity in the buckling failure of gesps
new mathematics has often been inspired by new insights into the natural world here we describe some ongoing and possible future interactions among the massive data sets being collected in neuroscience methods for their analysis and mathematical models of the underlying still largely uncharted neural substrates that generate these data we start by recalling events that occurred in turbulence modelling when substantial spacetime velocity field measurements and numerical simulations allowed a new perspective on the governing equations of fluid mechanics while no analogous global mathematical model of neural processes exists we argue that big data may enable validation or at least rejection of models at cellular to brain area scales and may illuminate connections among models we give examples of such models and survey some relatively new experimental technologies including optogenetics and functional imaging that can report neural activity in live animals performing complex tasks the search for analytical techniques for these data is already yielding new mathematics and we believe their multiscale nature may help relate wellestablished models such as the hodgkinhuxley equations for single neurons to more abstract models of neural circuits brain areas and larger networks within the brain in brief we envisage a closer liaison if not a marriage between neuroscience and mathematics
a literature review has identified the absence of a robust framework that guides the development of streamlined and valid multiple linear regression mlr predictive models for construction engineering applications a reliable mlr model requires an appropriate set of input variables that can satisfy the underlying assumptions of best linear unbiased estimators blue in this research an analytical framework is proposed for developing mlrbased predictive models by 1 selecting input variables based on a modified stepwise approach 2 verifying the blue assumptions and 3 validating the prediction performance of the regression model the resulting mlr model only contains the mostrelevant input variables while also fulfilling the blue assumptions by utilizing statistical inference techniques the mlr model also produces reliable range estimates around its pointvalue prediction according to a particular confidence level to illustrate the application procedure of the proposed framework a data set intended for workability control of readymixed concrete from the university of california irvine uci machine learning repository is used a practical case study based on a realworld bridge construction project is provided to further demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology in modeling the precast span installation cycletime c 2016 american society of civil engineers
programmable network like sdn allows administrators to program network infrastructure according to service demand and customdefined policies network policies are interpreted by the centralized controller to define actions and rules to process the network traffic on devices that belong to a single domain however actual networks are multidomain where several domains are interconnected then because sdn controllers in a domain cannot define nor monitor policies in other domains network administrators cannot ensure that their own policies origin policies are being enforced by the domains not directly managed by them ie foreign domains we present audit a multidomain sdn policy verifier that identifies whether an origin policy is enforced by foreign domains audit comprises 1 model for network topology policies and flows 2 an audit protocol to gather information about the actions performed by network devices to carry the flows of interest and 3 a validation engine that takes that information and detects security policy violations and 4 an extension to the openflow protocol to enable external auditing this paper presents our approach and illustrates its application using an example considering multiple sdn networks

between 1992 and 1998 55 km of riverbank on the ottawa river was protected from erosion using rounded granular material of glaciofluvial origin from local gravel pits the method did not require slope reprofiling or the installation of a key or geotextile it allows for the slopes of the structure and the banks to reach an equilibrium state and relies on natural vegetation regrowth on the banks and embankments rather than bioengineering revegetation techniques a followup was done in 2011 to assess its effectiveness after fifteen years the structures have halted erosion blended into the local landscape and created a riparian ecotone they quickly acquired a natural gently sloping profile and recreated a sinuous shoreline dotted with sandy beaches the followup also shows that the banks and structures are 8090% covered by indigenous vegetation furthermore this vegetation is as diverse as the natural vegetation seen on the unstabilized sections of riverbank the work minimized damage to the riverbanks as it was done in winter so that shore ice could be used for access this approach helped avoid interventions on the banks themselves and protected the existing vegetation the availability of granular sources near the work site was a key criterion riverbank protection work of this scale is uncommon this article discusses the effectiveness of the protection method and its environmental advantages and limitations this method could prove to be an alternative to traditional rockfill methods or bioengineering techniques which are often quite complex and costly c 2013 elsevier bv all rights reserved
openness to diversity is useful to adjustment in the diversified modern society but diversity can be perceived as a threat to one's identity and cultural values thus tendency to feel secure and not easily threatened attachment security may be associated with openness to diversity a path model hypothesized the associations between attachment insecurity ie attachment anxiety and avoidance and universaldiverse orientation udo; ie open attitude toward diversity both directly and indirectly through low selfesteem and interpersonal trust a structural equation modeling analysis using two samples n 338 and 350 respectively of us undergraduates revealed that attachment anxiety was associated with the udo cognitive component relativistic appreciation positively but its emotional component comfort with differences negatively suggesting ambivalent attitudes to diversity indirect effects were significant between attachment insecurity and udo through trust although selfesteem was associated with udo only through its association with trust it was suggested that mistrust in others' good intention might be why insecurely attached feel uncomfortable with the culturally different people c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

typical spinel ferrites of cofe2o4 and mnfe2o4 were studied as heterogeneous catalysts of peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of paracetamol apap in water the apap degradation followed a pseudofirstorder kinetics pattern r2 >095 under conditions tested in the presence of 02 catalyst apap with initial concentration of 10 mg/l would be 905% and 100% removed in cofe2o4/pms and mnfe2o4/pms system respectively higher catalyst dosage higher pms dosage neutral ph and lower concentration of ha favored apap degradation in each system after being recycled for three times mnfe2o4 and cofe2o4 could still effectively catalyze pms to react with apap with the removal efficiencies of 100% and 761% respectively the production of sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical was validated from the scavenging tests results showed that sulfate radical was the main reactive species responsible for apap degradation plausible mechanisms on the activation processes were proposed based on the radical identification tests and xps analysis showing that mn2+mn3+/fe3+fe2+ recycle and co2+co3+/fe3+fe2+ recycle on catalyst were responsible for the radical generation the results demonstrated that both cofe2o4 and mnfe2o4 mnps activated pms were promising technologies for water pollution caused by pharmaceuticals c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
studies in a variety of species have reported enhanced prosocial effects after an acute administration of the neuromodulating hormone oxytocin ot although the exact mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood there is broad interest in developing ot into a treatment for social deficits only a few studies however have examined the effects of ot if given repeatedly during early development the period when early intervention is likely to have the greatest benefits for reversing the progression towards social impairment those studies exclusively in rodents report mixed results some have shown enhancement of prosocial behavior including increased social exploration but others have shown antisocial effects including increased aggression in the present study infant rhesus macaques were treated with a highfrequency 3 x per week or lowfrequency 1 x per week dose of intranasal oxytocin inot or placebo insaline between two and six months of age after which their reactions to dynamic facial expressions neutral lipsmacking and threats were measured results showed that inot compared to placebo increased the time monkeys spent viewing the expression videos but selectively reduced attention to the eyes in neutral faces in a dose dependent manner the mechanism for this nonprosocial effect may be that repeated inot administration downregulates the expression of ot receptors in brain regions important for regulating social attention consequently our results raise questions about the efficacy of implementing chronic inot as a pharmacotherapy for the treatment of social deficits particularly if given early in development more work is needed not only to identify optimal treatment schedules but also to understand how inot exerts its influences on the brain and behavior c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the molecular basis for control of the cytoskeleton by the arf gtpaseactivating protein agap1 has not been characterized agap1 is composed of gproteinlike gld pleckstrin homology ph arf gap and ankyrin repeat domains kif2a was identified in screens for proteins that bind to agap1 the gld and ph domains of agap1 bound the motor domain of kif2a kif2a increased gap activity of agap1 and a protein composed of the gld and ph domains of agap1 increased atpase activity of kif2a knockdown kd of kif2a or agap1 slowed cell migration and accelerated cell spreading the effect of kif2a kd on spreading could be rescued by expression of kif2agfp or flagagap1 but not by kif2cgfp the effect of agap1 kd could be rescued by flagagap1 but not by an agap1 mutant that did not bind kif2a efficiently arfgap1ha or kif2agfp taken together the results support the hypothesis that the kif2aagap1 complex contributes to control of cytoskeleton remodeling involved in cell movement
since the beginning of this millennium shale gas extraction by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has boosted us gas production changing the global energy markets and leading to low natural gas and oil prices following the expansion of this industry other countries such as uk poland or china are exploring and supporting its extraction as a way to secure energy independence in an increasingly unstable geopolitical context and as an effective transition substitute for coal while moving towards a renewable energy market however there are important environmental concerns associated to shale gas production including atmospheric pollution and air quality issues risks of water pollution and nuisance to the population caused by road traffic and noise water management is one of the most challenging problems since hydraulic fracturing requires millions of liters of water and produces high volumes of liquid effluents at variable compositions and rates the present review focuses on the characteristics of this wastewater and the options existing to minimize its environmental impacts at the moment deep well injection and reuse are the most commonly employed strategies for this wastewater in the us but the stricter regulations in other regions will require further treatment partial treatment and reuse is the preferred option where feasible otherwise techniques such as mechanical vapor compression thermal distillation or forward osmosis may be needed in order to meet the requirements for discharge c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
a number of significant studies in the field of cell biology have revealed another pattern of intracellular signal transduction in which cells transmit information through the dynamics of key signaling molecules dynamical properties of p53 have been demonstrated to be the key factor in dictating cell fate including cell cycle arrest permanent cell cycle arrest and cell death previous studies showed a negative feedback regulation pathway between sgk1 and p53 but the dynamics of sgk1 have never been reported before therefore we used different dosing strategies of wogonin to affect sgk1 dynamics and investigate its impact on cell response key factors such as apaf1 bax gadd45a p21 pml and ypel3 which are related to cell cycle arrest senescence and apoptosis were measured at different time points after incubation with wogonin western blot and quantitative reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction analysis were used to examine protein and mrna expression of these genes in addition we also used betagalactosidase staining and flow cytometric analysis to further verify the results it was found that wogonin inhibited cell viability and downregulated sgk1 protein levels; 20 mu m wogonin could induce nonsmallcell lung cancer a549 cells into cell cycle arrest/senescence/apoptosis after 05/2/4 h respectively; and sgk1 dynamics showed significant differences under different cell responses together our findings showed that sgk1 protein dynamics can be an important part of intracellular signaling directly influencing cellular response decisions
recent experiments have shown that certain fluidmechanical systems namely oil droplets bouncing on oil films can mimic a wide range of quantum phenomena including doubleslit interference quantization of angular momentum and zeeman splitting here i investigate what can be learned from these systems concerning nogo theorems as those of bell and kochenspecker in particular a model for the bell experiment is proposed that includes variables describing a 'background' field or medium this field mimics the surface wave that accompanies the droplets in the fluidmechanical experiments it appears that quite generally such a model can violate the bell inequality and reproduce the quantum statistics even if it is based on local dynamics only the reason is that measurement independence is not valid in such models this opens the door for local 'backgroundbased' theories describing the interaction of particles and analyzers with a background field to complete quantum mechanics experiments to test these ideas are also proposed
recently vernier permanent magnet vpm machines one special case of magnetic fluxmodulated mfm machines benefiting from their compact simple construction and lowspeed/hightorque characteristics have been receiving increasing interest in this paper the vernier structure is integrated with an axialflux pm machine to obtain the magnetic gear effect and produce an improved torque density for directdrive wind power generation application another advantage of the proposed machine is that the stator flux rotating speed can be relatively high when the shaft speed is low with this benefit sensorless control strategy can be easily implemented in a wide speed range in this paper an improved sliding mode observer smo is proposed to estimate the rotor position and the speed of the proposed machine with the estimated shaft speeds the maximum power point tracking mppt control strategy is applied to maximize the wind power extraction the machine design and the sensorless mppt control strategy are verified by finite element analysis and experimental verification
stone columns installed in extremely soft soils may significantly reduce the effectiveness of this treatment due to the insufficient lateral confinement provided by the soft soil the encasement of columns with geotextiles is commonly used in these cases with satisfactory results thanks to the extra confinement provided by the geotextile to the column the influence of the encasement on the behavior of stone columns is studied by means of drained triaxial tests performed on encased and nonencased samples of gravel two different densities of the gravel and two different geotextiles were tested this study is focused on the increase in strength of encased samples compared with nonencased ones the extra confining pressure provided by the geotextiles and the mobilized friction angle of the gravel all of the results show the improvement achieved when the gravel is encased with the geotextiles this effect is more significant at lower confining pressures c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the frequent widespread use of pesticides in agriculture adversely affects biodiversity human health and water quality in 2008 the french government adopted an environmental policy plan ecophyto 2018 to halve pesticide use within 10 years trends in synthetic pesticide sales and use in france were described through three different indicators: the number of unit doses nud the quantity of active ingredient qai and the treatment frequency index tfi changes in pesticide use on seven of the principal arable crops in france since the implementation of this policy plan were analyzed together with the impact of changes in pesticide use on water quality no evidence was found for a decrease in pesticide sales at national level between 2008 and 2013 in terms of the tfi values for individual crops the only decrease in pesticide use observed since 2001 was for soft wheat this decrease was very slight and pesticide use did not decline more rapidly after 2006 than before changes in pesticide use differed between french regions and crops water pollution did not decrease during the period studied possible explanations for the lack of effectiveness of the french environmental plan are considered in the context of european legislation c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved

because of a lack of existing studies of fatigue testing of interlaminar anticracking materials this study analyzes the principle of generating reflective cracks using three types of composite specimens: a direct overlay asphalt mixture layer a repaving impregnated nonwoven geotextile layer and a repaving anticracking material layer the study proposes a method for laboratory fatigue testing and observing reflective cracks the specimens were used in a bending fatigue test with a centric load and a shear fatigue test with an eccentric load the test results were analyzed by regression analyses that showed that the anticracking material layer had much better crack resistance than the direct overlay asphalt mixture layer and the repaving impregnated nonwoven geotextiles layer because the anticracking material layer could absorb most of bending and shear stresses near the cracks to efficiently delay the generation and expansion of reflective cracks this study can be used as a reference to make a reasonable selection of an interlaminar anticracking material for rigid flexible composite pavements c 2016 american society of civil engineers

the dynamic response of a sphere in soft clay is considered through field tests in which a 025 m dia steel sphere was allowed to freefall in water and dynamically penetrate the underlying soft soil the test data collected in a lake and a sea environment relate to sphere velocities of up to 8 m/s reaching sphere invert embedments close to ten diameters an inertial measurement unit located within the sphere measured the motion response of the sphere during freefall and penetration in soil the resulting acceleration data were used within a simple framework that accounts for both geotechnical shearing resistance and fluid mechanics drag resistance but cast in terms of a single capacity factor that can be expressed in terms of the nonnewtonian reynolds number the merit of the framework is demonstrated by using it as a forward model in a series of inverse analyses that calculate the undrained shear strength profile from acceleration data measured in freefall sphere tests the good match between these profiles and those obtained from 'pushin' piezoball penetrometer tests points to the potential for an instrumented freefall sphere to be used as a tool for characterising the nearsurface strength of soft seabeds

human behaviour is contextdependent based on predictions and influenced by the environment and other people we live in a dynamic world where both the social stimuli and their context are constantly changing similar dynamic natural stimuli should in the future be increasingly used to study social brain functions with parallel development of appropriate signalanalysis methods understanding dynamic neural processes also requires accurate timesensitive characterization of the behaviour to go beyond the traditional stimulus response approaches brain activity should be recorded simultaneously from two interacting subjects to reveal why human social interaction is critically different from just reacting to each other this theme issue on attending to and neglecting people contains original work and review papers on person perception and social interaction the articles cover research from neuroscience psychology robotics animal interaction research and microsociology some of the papers are coauthored by scientists who presented their own independent views in the recent attention and performance xxvi conference but were brave enough to join forces with a colleague having a different background and views in the future information needs to converge across disciplines to provide us a more holistic view of human behaviour its interactive nature as well as the temporal dynamics of our social world
the increasing air pollution of urban areas caused by particulate matter poses a problem for human health plants are able to bind the fine dust particles on their surface and to remove them therefore from the air therefore roof plantings can contribute to the reduction of fine particulate matter pollution in cities to identify roof vegetation forms with high filter ability suitable test procedures are missing up to now trials to identify the filtering potential of different roof top vegetation mats were conducted in a 1 m 3 big perspex chamber under controlled conditions geotextile mats with sedum and moss vegetation were compared uncovered geotextile mats as well as crushed stones were used as controls in the measuring chamber artificial particulate matter firefighting powder was applied and the concentration of particle fractions of 03 05 and 1 a mu m over the period of 90 min measured during 5 min in the middle of the 90 minute measuring period wind with a speed of 2 m/s in 10 cm height was generated by means of a ventilating fan particulate matter binding capacity of different greening mats was determined as difference between the particle concentration after application of the dust concentration maximum and the concentration at the end of the trial after 90minute dust exposition significantly lower dust concentrations in the chamber were registered in the treatments with sedum mats compared to the controls reductions from: 113 % in the fraction of 03 a mu m 309 % in the fraction of 05 a mu m and 334 % in the fraction of 1 a mu m particles none of the mat variations could bind the particulate matter in the fraction of 03 a mu m under wind speed of 2 m/s however the moss as well as the sedum mats reduced the particulate matter concentration of both 05 and 1 a mu m fractions under wind significantly compared to the controls the high filter performance of sedum can be explained due to the high surface of the plants to what extent plants can bind or uptake particulate matter under outdoor conditions permanently cannot be cleared in this experiment however the system allows to measure differences in binding capacity for different rooftop greening sytems

research into ambient assisted living aal strives to ease the daily lives of people with disabilities or chronic medical conditions aal systems typically consist of multitudes of sensors and embedded devices generating large amounts of medical and ambient data however these biomedical sensors lack the processing power to perform key monitoring and dataaggregation tasks necessitating data transmission and computation at central locations the focus here is on the development of a scalable and contextaware framework and easing the flow between data collection and data processing the resourceconstrained nature of typical wearable body sensors is factored into our proposed model with cloud computing features utilized to provide a realtime assistedliving service with the myriad of distributed aal systems at play each with unique requirements and eccentricities the challenge lies in the need to service these disparate systems with a middleware layer that is both coherent and flexible there is significant complexity in the management of sensor data and the derivation of contextual information as well as in the monitoring of user activities and in locating appropriate situational services the proposed cocamaal model seeks to address such issues and implement a serviceoriented architecture soa for unified context generation this is done by efficiently aggregating raw sensor data and the timely selection of appropriate services using a context management system cms with a unified model that includes patients devices and computational servers in a single virtual community aal services are enhanced we have prototyped the proposed model and implemented some case studies to demonstrate its effectiveness c 2013 elsevier bv all rights reserved
most analyses of sexual orientation and earnings find that gay men face a wage gap whereas lesbian women earn higher wages than similar heterosexual women however analyses rarely consider bisexual men and women as a unique group separate from other sexual minorities i argue that such binary views of sexual orientationtreating sexual minorities as a homogenous nonheterosexual grouphave obscured understandings of the impact of sexual orientation on labor market outcomes specifically i predict that unequal outcomes for gay men and lesbian women are partly due to the influence of family arrangements and their effects on earnings in contrast i argue that bisexual men and women should be the most disadvantaged in the labor market due to particularly disadvantaging stereotypes perceptions of choice to their sexual orientation and prejudicial treatment using data from the general social survey n 13 554 and the national longitudinal study of adolescent to adult health n 14 714 i show that family arrangements explain some of the observed earnings differentials for gay men and lesbian women bisexual men and women in contrast face wage penalties that are not explained by human capital differences or occupational characteristics perceptions of prejudicial treatment partially explain the observed wage gaps
this paper presents three case histories on retaining earth structure failures in indonesia and how to remedy it the triggering problem will be analyzed and discussed finally design procedure and its remedial structure of reinforced slope using geosynthetic are discussed and simple guidelines are proposed with a selection of geosynthetic reinforcement types and system the first case is on a river side slope located in bali a retaining earth structure of 12 m height was constructed using soldier piles during the rainy season the river in front of structure flooded and increased the pore water pressure behind it the rapid draw down process of river water then collapsed the soldier pile structure a solution combining high strength composite geotextile reinforcement and gabion facing was chosen and successfully executed the second case is also on a river side slope located in south sumatra the previous structure was sheetpile after a while the sheetpiles were pushed before filling work was even carried out a solution using polyester geogrid was analyzed and proposed the geogrid elements were installed behind the existing sheetpile without removing them and/or change to geogrid reinforced gabion the remedial work was successful and this system was applied to solve other problems of similar nature in the same project the third case is on a cutting slope located in west java the existing area is almost flat with a 20m height difference to the surrounding area and consists of expansive soil and/or clay shale for development purposes the area was then cut leaving 10m slope to be strengthened by woven pp geotextile unfortunately several weeks after the project completion it failed a proposed solution using the same material is submitted by considering several additional technical aspects based on the studies it is concluded that retaining earth structures can be done with several different materials and approaches as long as they are applied in the right conditions bearing in mind the different influential factor involved
the goal of the current study was to examine whether differential neural attentional capture and evaluative responses for outgroup homosexual relative to ingroup heterosexual targets occur during social categorization to this end 36 heterosexual participants were presented with pictures of heterosexual and homosexual couples in a pictureviewing task that was designed to assess implicit levels of discomfort toward homosexuality and explicit evaluations of pleasantness toward the images neural activity in the form of electroencephalogram was recorded during the presentation of the pictures and eventrelated potentials resulting from these stimuli were examined participants also completed questionnaires that assessed the degree to which they socialized with gays and lesbians results demonstrated that relative to straight couples larger p2 amplitude was observed in response to gay but not to lesbian couples however both gay and lesbian couples yielded a larger late positive potential than straight couples moreover the degree to which participants differentially directed early neural attention to outgroup lesbian versus ingroup straight couples was related to their familiarity with homosexual individuals this work which provides an initial understanding of the neural underpinnings of attention toward homosexual couples suggests that differences in the processing of sexual orientation can occur as early as 200ms and may be moderated by familiarity
sea surface temperature sst plays a fundamental role in the exchange of heat momentum and water vapor between atmosphere and ocean therefore measurement of sst has been done from ships buoys offshore platforms and satellites during past decades satellites are being increasingly used because datasets over wide areas can be obtained in this paper moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis on board terra and aqua sst products were examined and validated for coastal waters in the yellow sea by using the in situ buoy data a strict matchup method was adopted in view of the complexity and variability of coastal area resulting in 154 and 164 matchups for terra and aqua respectively the modis sst agreed well with in situ buoy sst with squared correlation coefficients r2 of 0989 for terra and 0987 for aqua relative to in situ ssts the satellitederived ssts had a bias of 023 degrees c and 006 degrees c a standard deviation of 079 degrees c and 085 degrees c and a root mean square error of 083 degrees c and 085 degrees c for terra and aqua the differences between modis and in situ sst exhibited apparent seasonal variations the accuracy of modis sst products for spring and summer were lower than those for autumn andwinter which could be caused by frequent sea fog along the southern coast of shandong peninsula the sst bias approximately depended on wind velocity; low wind velocity could enhance the diurnal sst amplitude and the bulkskin temperature difference however there is no significant dependence of the bias on airsea temperature difference or surface flow velocity

this paper presents a moderated target assembly design study for minor actinide ma transmutation in the firststage sodiumcooled fast reactor fr to reduce the amount of ma to be sent to the secondstage accelerator driven system ads in a twostage fr/ads fuel cycle option in order to minimize the local power peaking problem induced by moderated target assemblies the target assemblies were loaded in the reflector region using ma40zr target composition and zrh16 moderator an optimum ma target assembly design was developed to maximize the ma destruction within the practical thermal design limits on the cladding inner wall temperature longlived fission product pins were used as thermal neutron filters to reduce the local power peaking in the adjacent fuel assemblies due to the thermal neutron leakage from the moderated target assembly the performance characteristics of the fr with moderated target assemblies were evaluated by performing detailed neutronics and thermalhydraulics analyses analysis results showed that the use of ma target assemblies reduces the amount of ma to be sent to ads by a factor of six without deteriorating safety characteristics as a result the electricity sharing of ads in a nuclear park composed of frs and adss was reduced to 03% from 19% c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
agitation associated with dementia is frequently reported clinically but has received little attention in preclinical models of dementia the current study used a 7pa2 cm intracerebroventricular injection model of alzheimer's disease ad to assess acute memory impairment and a bilateral intrahippocampal ih injection model of ad aggregated a beta 142 injections and a bilateral ih injection model of dementia with lewy bodies aggregated nac 6195 injections to assess chronic memory impairment in the rat an alternatinglever cyclicratio schedule of operant responding was used for data collection where incorrect lever perseverations measured executive function memory and running response rates rrr measured behavioral output agitation the results indicate that bilateral ih injections of a beta 142 and bilateral ih injections of nac 6195 decreased memory function and increased rrrs whereas intracerebroventricular injections of 7pa2 cm decreased memory function but did not increase rrrs these findings show that using the aggregated peptide ih injection models of dementia to induce chronic neurotoxicity memory decline was accompanied by elevated behavioral output this demonstrates that ih peptide injection models of dementia provide a preclinical screen for pharmacological interventions used in the treatment of increased behavioral output agitation which also establish detrimental side effects on memory c 2017 wolters kluwer health inc all rights reserved
the parameters of nonlinear muskingum model nlmm are usually assumed to be constant during the flood routing period recently the need to consider a variable exponent parameter for the nlmm has been emphasised a suitable continuous variable exponent parameter can substantially improve the model in this study an appropriate continuous inflowbased exponent is proposed for the nlmm the discharges of inflow hydrographs of future events may be different and larger than the discharges of inflow hydrographs used in the calibration stage and thus the proposed inflowbased function for the exponent parameter is considered such that it varies only in a small range regardless of the size of the future inflow hydrographs and their durations safe extrapolation when volumes of the inflow and outflow hydrographs are different the lateral flows are expected to play a relevant role in the flood routing procedure these effects are also considered in this research the proposed model was implemented and tested on three different sets of benchmark hydrographs from the literature and the improvement in performance of the proposed model was considerable

the turbulent wake of a generic space launcher wind tunnel model with an underexpanded nozzle jet is investigated experimentally and numerically to gain insight into the variation of intricate wake flow phenomena of space vehicles at higher stages of the flight trajectory with increasing mach number the experiments are carried out at minfinity 3 and minfinity 6 in the ludwieg tube test facility at the institute of fluid mechanics at the technische universitat braunschweig while the corresponding timeresolved computations are performed by the institute of aerodynamics at rwth aachen university using a zonal ransles approach a strong alteration of the wake topology with increasing mach number due to the changing pressure ratio at the nozzle exit is found at minfinity 3 the moderate underexpansion rate of p e /p infinity approximate to 5 leads to a formation of a recirculation region with an elongated triangular crosssection reaching to the nozzle exit at minfinity 6 a substantially stronger afterexpansion of the jet plume p e /p infinity approximate to 100 causes the formation of a cavity region with a quadrangular crosssection the stronger deflection towards the nozzle at minfinity 3 results in lower mean and rms wall pressure ratios than at minfinity 6 however due to the higher freestream pressure value at the lower mach number the relation of absolute values is reciprocal making the lower supersonic regime more critical with respect to dynamic structural loads this observation is confirmed by an overall good agreement between numerical and experimental data at characteristic positions on the base and nozzle wall furthermore it was shown that undesired effects of the strut support in the wake are present along the whole circumference for minfinity 3 the strut influence is found to be particularly intense the spectral analysis of wall pressure fluctuations reveals fundamental differences in the dynamic behavior of the two investigated wake flow regimes at minfinity 3 a dominant frequency range around srd approximate to 02 associated with the inner dynamics of the recirculation bubble is found at the base while on the nozzle a broadband lowfrequency content of substantially higher amplitudes is detected which is a footprint of the graduate realignment of the turbulent shear layer along the nozzle wall the spectra at minfinity 6 are characterized by several highfrequency sharp peaks at srd >08 a strong correlation between the supported wind tunnel configuration and the axisymmetric freeflight case is found for the peaks at srd approximate to 085 known to be caused by the radial flapping motion of the shear layer along the cavity
since the introduction of biologics many concerns about the increased risk of infections have been reported and to date the real impact of infections on the daily practice in the rheumatologic centers is still largely unknown in this work we evaluated the infection rates associated with the use of biologics in a large cohort of patients a prospective study between january 2010 and december 2013 enrolling 731 rheumatic patients was performed demographic and disease characteristics therapies comorbidities and infectious events were recorded and statistically analyzed by multivariate analysis twohundred thirtyfive infectious episodes were observed in 284 % of patients about total infections bacteria were identified in 706 % of total cases and viruses in 183 % the most common site of notserious infection was the urinary tract duration of disease longer followup concomitant steroid therapy and comorbidities were significantly associated with notserious infection in our cohort 17 episodes fulfilled the criteria of serious infection and occurred in 17 different patients 23 % the majority involving the lower respiratory tract serious infections were associated with the beginning of biologics in older age our prospective observational study showed that in daily practice a lesser rate of serious as well as notserious infections may be observed in rheumatic patients treated with biologics than those reported in previous papers the most common sites of notserious infections are both the urinary and the respiratory tracts and for serious infections the respiratory tract when pathogens were isolated we did not find any multidrugresistant organism
brown and beige adipose tissue may represent important therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetes and obesity as these organs dissipate nutrient energy as heat through the thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 ucp1 while mice are commonly used to mimic the potential effects of brown/beige adipose tissue that may act in human metabolism new animal models are edging into the market for translational medicine pigs reflect human metabolism better than mice in multiple parameters such as obesityinduced hyperglycemia cholesterol profiles and energy metabolism recently it was reported that energy expenditure and body temperature in pigs is induced by the hormone leptin and that leptin's action is mediated by ucp1 in adipose tissue given the tremendous importance of identifying molecular mechanisms for targeting therapeutics we critically examine the evidence supporting the presence of ucp1 in pigs and conclude that methodological shortcomings prevent an unequivocal claim for the presence of ucp1 in pigs despite this we believe that leptin's effects on energy expenditure in pigs are potentially more transformative to human medicine in the absence of ucp1 as adult and obese humans possess only minor amounts of ucp1 in general we propose that the biology of new animal models requires attention to comparative studies with humans given the increasing amount of genomic information for various animal species c 2015 the authors published by elsevier gmbh this is an open access article under the cc byncnd license http://creativecommonsorg/licenses/byncnd/40/

there have been many robust image steganography methods that are invented in recent decades however this technique also may be used by malicious users to transmit dangerous information through the internet beyond the control of the security agencies how to detect and/or block potentially dangerous information transmission on the internet through billions of images while not affecting the normal digital images becomes a challenging problem existing steganalysis methods or steganography attacking methods cannot be used for analyzing a large volume of digital images in a short time in this paper we propose an effective steganography attacking method that is not limited by the types of the steganography method the proposed method can process the digital images to remove the potentially dangerous hidden information while keeping the digital image in a high visual quality inspired by the way in which printers and scanners work our method decouples the human visual perception and the digital image's numerical values it causes the numerical values of the image to change dramatically and then the hidden information are largely damaged while at the same time the visual image quality can be maintained our experimental results have demonstrated that the peak signaltonoise ratio of images can be above 32 db while the stego data are destroyed copyright c 2016 john wiley & sons ltd
in this study we define and characterize the saltwater upconing zone of influence suzi the suzi is the region around a pumping well within which significant rise in the saltwaterfreshwater interface occurs while the zone of influence of a pumping well can be clearly defined in terms of hydraulics eg drawdown the suzi has not been recognised and characterised despite its importance for groundwater decisionmaking in coastal regions we explore the suzi under various conditions and compare common methods of investigation using both axisymmetric 1d and 2d vertical crosssection and 3d simulations of saltwater upconing at the field scale based on a combination of numerical and analytical approaches the suzi was found to be dependent on the relative magnitudes of pumping regional flow distance of the well from the coast and position of the well above the interface as expected the threedimensional coastal setting simulations revealed an asymmetric shape of the lateral extent of the suzi which is largest in the direction parallel to the coast this occurs because the ocean and the inland extent of the seawater wedge limit the propagation of the suzi perpendicular to the coast predictions of the suzi using the ghybenherzberg approximation including cases where sloping interfaces occur ie in contrast to the artificiality of horizontal interfaces used in axisymmetric approaches provide reasonable first approximations of the suzi numerical modelling of dispersive upconing in the 3d inclined interface case is influenced by practical limits to the model domain size and grid resolution for example the noflow boundary condition at 1500 m from the pumping well elongates the suzi in the direction parallel to the coast this study extends previous concepts of well interference which have previously been based on hydraulics only by introducing the suzi and characterising its extent with consideration given to differences in commonly adopted methods of upconing quantification c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

one result of globalization is the rapid growth of offshoring ie the outsourcing of functions and jobs to offshore locations in the usa offshoring has progressed to the point where it already affects everyday lives from the cars we drive of which a large portion of the work and components are outsourced to computers which are typically manufactured offshore and shipped back to the usa to electronic diagnostics where calls are answered overseas this phenomenon has implications on our lives and on the jobs that engineers and scientists will assume both now and in the future further it is something that all highly developed and even some lesserdeveloped countries must face consequently the growth of outsourcing will have a major impact on the educational objectives of engineering programs and the resultant engineering curricula worldwide this paper presents recent data on product and job offshore migrations and discusses the various dimensions of this phenomenon in addition to the potential loss of engineering and other highend technical jobs sociological and cultural aspects intellectual property issues strategic planning concerns and macroeconomic issues are presented for example the effects of offshoring on the societal fabric of the countries that are recipients of manufacturing and service center outsourcing such as china and india are significant rapid and controversial offshoring has also begun to change the way that engineering programs in these countries educate their students in addition intellectual property issues create a major risk to companies considering outsourcing to certain lessdeveloped countries these issues can be broadly categorized into: the robustness and strength of intellectual property laws and the degree to which these laws are implemented and enforced further such factors as currency fluctuations and geopolitical conditions can substantially impact outsourcing decisions and profitability the phenomenon of offshoring which is now affecting engineering careers will play a major role in shaping engineering education worldwide the next generation of engineers will need to possess the ability to work seamlessly across cultures have outstanding communication skills and be familiar with the principles of project management logistics and systems integration some educational models that begin to address these requirements will be presented c 2006 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

mimicry involves unconsciously imitating the actions of others and is a powerful and ubiquitous behavior in social interactions there has been a long debate over whether mimicry is abnormal in people with autism spectrum conditions asc and what the causes of any differences might be wang and hamilton's 2012 social topdown response modulation storm model proposed that people with asc can and do mimic but unlike neurotypical participants fail to modulate their mimicry according to the social context this study used an established mimicry paradigm to test this hypothesis in neurotypical participants direct gaze specifically enhanced congruent hand actions as previously found; in the asc sample direct gaze led to faster reaction times in both congruent and incongruent movements this result shows that mimicry is intact in asc but is not socially modulated by gaze as predicted by storm

alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that has links with other conditions that can often be modified by dietary and lifestyle interventions in particular coconut oil has received attention as having potentially having benefits in lessening the cognitive deficits associated with alzheimer's disease in a recent report we showed that neuron survival in cultures cotreated with coconut oil and all was rescued compared to cultures exposed only to all here we investigated treatment with a beta for 1 6 or 24 h followed by addition of coconut oil for a further 24 h or treatment with coconut oil for 24 h followed by a beta exposure for various periods neuronal survival and several cellular parameters cleaved caspase 3 synaptophysin labeling and ros were assessed in addition the influence of these treatments on relevant signaling pathways was investigated with western blotting in terms of the treatment timing our data indicated that coconut oil rescues cells preexposed to a beta for 1 or 6 h but is less effective when the preexposure has been 24 h however pretreatment with coconut oil prior to a beta exposure showed the best outcomes treatment with octanoic or lauric acid also provided protection against a beta but was not as effective as the complete oil the coconut oil treatment reduced the number of cells with cleaved caspase and ros labeling as well as rescuing the loss of synaptophysin labeling observed with a beta treatment treatment with coconut oil as well as octanoic decanoic and lauric acids resulted in a modest increase in ketone bodies compared to controls the biochemical data suggest that akt and erk activation may contribute to the survival promoting influence of coconut oil this was supported by observations that a pi3kinase inhibitor blocked the rescue effect of cooil on a beta amyloid toxicity further studies into the mechanisms of action of coconut oil and its constituent medium chain fatty acids are warranted c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

in highperformance magnetic resonance imaging systems the gradient driver is required to supply the gradient coil with a large current >600 a and a high voltage >2000 v to achieve a strong gradient field and a fast slew rate in addition extremely high fidelity for reproducing the current command from the central system is very critical to imaging quality this paper presents the solutions for the different elements of the driver: 1 highbandwidth bw power inverter; 2 ripple cancelation filter; 3 multioutput power supply ps ; and 4 digital control a highbw power inverter requires a stackedbridges structure to achieve a high output ripple frequency with the existing commercial power semiconductor modules the high voltage and the high frequency for large power modules can be obtained easier and with lower loss using the new silicon carbide devices the control needs a digital implementation and a very fast processor digital control provides compensation and feedforward to improve the response a capability improvement is obtained by reducing the switching frequency when large currents with a very lowfrequency variation are needed the control can handle it very well but the filter has to be designed to eliminate more than one ripple frequency finally many ps solutions have been used for multiple isolated outputs but digital control compensation permits the use of much simpler unregulated ps and keeps the performance a 2 mva 900 a/1200 v platform has been built and fully tested the experimental results proved the validity of the proposed structure and the modulation technique
the present mechanism of metabolic formation of cholesterol is discussed and difficulties arising with the mechanism highlighted a revision of the chemical reactions in biological cells which give rise to cholesterol and other sterols is presented this mechanism of cholesterol formation is based on the forms and properties of polyphosphoric acids which are compounds common to both plant and animal cells the reactions are examples of biochemical reactions which involve the stereochemistry of an inorganic molecule as well as the stereochemistry of organic molecules it is demonstrated that cholesterol and related compounds entering or produced in the human metabolism are decomposed by the fluids of the digestive system and one product recycled for the production of further cholesterol links between the formation of cholesterol and degenerate conditions such as obesity and diabetes encountered in the human metabolism are discussed obesity and metabolism 2011; 7: e6e16
as an important preprocessing stage in many machine learning and pattern recognition domains feature selection deems to identify the most discriminate features for a compact data representation as typical feature selection methods lasso and its variants using the l 1 norm based regularization have received much attention in recent years however most of existing l 1 norm based sparse feature selection methods ignore the structure information of data or only consider the pairwise relationships among samples in this paper we propose a hypergraph regularized sparse feature learning method where the highorder relationships among samples are modeled and incorporated into the learning process specifically we first construct a hypergraph with multiple hyperedges to capture the highorder relationships among samples followed by the computation of a hypergraph laplacian matrix then we propose a hypergraph regularization term and a hypergraph regularized lasso model we conduct a series of experiments on a number of data sets from uci machine learning repository and two realworld neuroimaging based classification tasks experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising classification results compared with several well known feature selection approaches
recent years have seen a growing interest in pbc within the scientific community healthcare providers and industries coupled with great advances in the understanding of the molecular and genetic basis and the natural history of the disease several diseasemodifying agents targeting the immunemediated response and bileacid therapies are at different stages of development some with promising results a new drug obeticholic acid has been recently registered in the us and europe as a secondline treatment in refractory pbc international cohort studies have highlighted a disease heterogeneity and so the need to provide patients with a more personalised management based on their risk of disease progression major challenges remain the development of surrogate endpoints in clinical trials acceptable to regulatory authorities in a disease with a relatively low rate of events; and the development of clinical tools for patient's risk stratification and selection of those with greatest potential benefit from secondline therapies
background and aims: the recent opioid epidemic has prompted renewed interest in opioid use disorder treatment but there is little evidence regarding healthrelated qualityoflife hrqol outcomes in treatment programs measuring hrqol represents an opportunity to consider outcomes of opioid use disorder treatment that are more patientcentered and more relevant to overall health than abstinence alone we conducted a systematic literature review to explore the extent to which the collection of hrqol by opioid treatment programs is documented in the treatment program literature materials and methods: we searched pubmed embase psycinfo and web of science for papers published between 1965 and 2015 that reported hrqol outcome measures from substance abuse treatment programs results: of the 3014 unduplicated articles initially identified for screening 99 articles met criteria for further review of those articles 7 were unavailable in english; therefore 92 articles were reviewed of these articles 44 included any qualityoflife measure 17 of which included validated hrqol measures and 10 supported derivation of qualityadjusted life year utility weights the most frequently used validated measure was the addiction severity index asi nonus and more recent studies were more likely to include a measure of hrqol conclusions: hrqol measures are rarely used as outcomes in opioid treatment programs the field should incorporate hrqol measures as standard practice especially measures that can be used to derive utility weights such as the sf12 or eq5d these instruments provide policy makers with evidence on the impact of programs on patients' lives and with data to quantify the value of investing in opioid use disorder treatments c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved
cospeech gestures in autism spectrum disorder asd are poorly understood historically all gestures were thought to be reduced in this socialcommunicative disorder; however reduced gestures have not been consistently demonstrated in the empirical literature just as protodeclarative pointing is reduced in young children with asd while protoimperative pointing is not the varied functions of cospeech gesture may explain these mixed findings verbally fluent adolescents with asd n 18 and controls n 18 completed a narrative task and a standardized executive function task gestures on the narrative task which serve a wide range of social and cognitive functions were reduced in asd gestures on the executive function task which serve primarily cognitive functions were increased in asd gesture function may be the best predictor of the presence or absence of gesture in asd despite reduced socialcommunicative gestures individuals with asd may benefit from gesture's internal cognitive functions

studying brain abnormalities in behavioral addiction including gd enables us to exclude possible confounding effects of exposure to neurotoxic substances which should provide important insight that can lead to a better understanding of addiction per se there have been a few brain structural magnetic resonance imaging studies for gd although the results have been inconsistent on the other hand gd was suggested to be a heterogeneous disorder in terms of risk attitude we aimed to examine the heterogeneity of gd by combining a behavioral economics task and voxelbased morphometry thirtysix male gd patients and 36 healthy male control subjects underwent a task for estimation of loss aversion which can assess risk attitude in reallife decisionmaking the gd patients were divided into two groups based on their level of loss aversion low and high while both groups showed common gray matter volume reduction in the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral posterior cerebellum high lossaversion gd showed pronounced reduction in the left posterior cerebellum and additional reduction in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex our study suggests that the heterogeneity of gd is underpinned at the brain structural level this result might be useful for understanding neurobiological mechanisms and for the establishment of precise treatment strategies for gd c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
purpose of review the rapid development of remote sensing technology hasmade dense 3d data available from airborne laser scanning and recently also photogrammetric point clouds this paper reviews methods for extraction of individual trees from 3d data and their applications in forestry and ecology recent findings methods for analysis of 3d data at tree level have been developed since the turn of the century the first algorithms were based on 2d surface models of the upper contours of tree crowns these methods are robust and provide information about the trees in the topmost canopy there are also methods that use the complete 3d data however development of these 3d methods is still needed to include use of geometric properties to detect a large fraction of the tallest trees a surface model method generally gives the best results but detection of smaller trees below the topmost canopy requires methods utilizing the whole point cloud several new sensors are now available with capability to describe the upper part of the canopy which can be used to frequently update vegetation maps highly sensitive laser photo detectors have become available for civilian applications which will enable acquisition of highresolution 3d laser data for large areas to much lower costs summary methods for itc delineation from 3d data provide information about a large fraction of the trees but there is still a challenge to make optimal use of the information from whole point cloud newly developed sensors might make itc methods cheaper and feasible for large areas
research has shown that jurors are heavily influenced by secondary confessions and that they may attribute the informant's motives to good character rather than to an incentive this study investigated the role of race in this context by manipulating both defendant and informant race black/white informant type jailhouse/civic duty and whether the informant received an incentive to testify participants read a trial transcript and provided a verdict then answered questions about the informant's reason for testifying ie attributions we observed that in the absence of informant testimony participants convicted the white defendant more often we also discovered an effect of incentive on verdicts when the defendant was white such that participants voted guilty less often when the informant received an incentive; there was no effect of incentive on verdict when the defendant was black informant race defendant race and incentive showed a combined effect on verdict such that participants were particularly suspicious ie less likely to vote guilty when a black informant received an incentive for testifying against a black defendant there were no effects of race on attributions this research sheds light on extralegal factors that can prevent jurors from considering the role of incentives in secondary confessions

the decreasing cost and size of video sensors has led to camera networks becoming pervasive in our lives however the ability to analyze these images effectively is very much a function of the quality of the acquired images in this paper we consider the problem of automatically controlling the fields of view of individual pantiltzoom ptz cameras in a camera network leading to improved situation awareness e g where and what are the critical targets and events in a region of interest the network of cameras attempts to observe the entire region of interest at some minimum resolution while opportunistically acquiring high resolution images of critical events in real time since many activities involve groups of people interacting an important decision that the network needs to make is whether to focus on individuals or groups of them this is achieved by understanding the performance of video analysis tasks and designing camera control strategies to improve a metric that quantifies the quality of the source imagery optimization strategies along with a distributed implementation are proposed and their theoretical properties analyzed the proposed methods bring together computer vision and network control ideas the performance of the proposed methodologies discussed herein has been evaluated on a reallife wireless network of ptz capable cameras
in this paper for the first time we report a nonmonotonic dependence of the snapback voltage vsb on the buried oxide thickness t box in silicononinsulator laterally doublediffused mos soildmos transistors stepbystep analysis of this effect is carried out by decoupling the selfheating and impactionization effects that cause the turning on of the parasitic bipolar junction transistor bjt and subsequently the snapback effect it is observed that for ldmos transistors with low t box vsb increases with increase in t box due to reduction in drain current density as well as reduced impact ionization at higher lattice temperature on the other hand for high t box vsb reduces with the increase in t box due to early switching on of the parasitic bjt at higher temperature therefore it is possible to find an optimum value of t box to obtain the highest vsb for an soildmos transistor an interesting observation is that with proper choice of t box the safe operating area in soildmos can be more than that of the corresponding bulkldmos a physicsbased compact model is developed and implemented in veriloga when compared with the technology computer aided design simulated results our model exhibits high level of accuracy
mceliece and goldreichgoldwasserhalevi ggh cryptosystems are two instances of code and latticebased cryptosystems whose security are based on the hardness of coding theoretic and lattice problems respectively however such cryptosystems have a number of drawbacks which make them inefficient in practice on the other hand low density lattice codes ldlcs are practical lattice codes which can achieve capacity over additive white gaussian noise channel and also can be encoded and decoded efficiently this paper introduces a public key cryptosystem based on latin square ldlcs by which a relationship can be attained between code and latticebased cryptography in this way we can exploit the efficient properties of codes and lattices simultaneously to improve the security and efficiency of the proposed scheme for instance the security of this scheme is based on the hard problems related to lattices ie closest vector problem and shortest basis problem which in turn lead to increase the security level on the other hand we exploit the low complexity decoding algorithm of ldlcs to reduce the computational complexity moreover this property allows using the larger values of the codeword length also we use the special gaussian vector whose variance is upper bounded by poltyrev bound as the perturbation error vector these strategies make the proposed scheme to be secure against the conventional cryptanalytic attacks
the national demand for water in the uk is predicted to increase exacerbated by a growing uk population and homegrown demands for energy and food when set against the context of overstretched existing supply sources vulnerable to droughts particularly in increasingly dense city centres the delicate balance of matching minimal demands with resource secure supplies becomes critical when making changes to internal demands the role of technological efficiency and user behaviour cannot be ignored yet existing benchmarking systems traditionally do not consider the latter this paper investigates the practicalities of adopting a domestic benchmarking system using a band rating that allows individual users to assess their current water use performance against what is possible the benchmarking system allows users to achieve higher benchmarks through any approach that reduces water consumption the sensitivity of water use benchmarks are investigated by making changes to user behaviour and technology the impact of adopting localised supplies ie rainwater harvestingrwh and grey watergw and including external gardening demands are investigated this includes the impacts in isolation and combination of the following: occupancy rates 1 to 4 ; roof size 125 m 2 to 100 m 2 ; garden size 25 m 2 to 100 m 2 and geographical location north west midlands and south east uk with yearly temporal effects ie rainfall and temperature lessons learnt from analysis of the proposed benchmarking system are made throughout this paper in particular its compatibility with the existing code for sustainable homes csh accreditation system conclusions are subsequently drawn for the robustness of the proposed system
composite penalties have been widely used for inducing structured properties in the empirical risk minimization erm framework in machine learning such composite regularizers despite their superior performance in grasping structural sparsity properties are often nonsmooth and even nonconvex which makes the problem difficult to optimize proximal average pa is a recently proposed approximation technique targeting these regularizers which features the tractability of implementation and theoretical analysis however current pabased methods notwithstanding the promising performance of handling composite penalties against traditional techniques are either slow in convergence or do not scale well to large datasets to make pa an ideal technique for optimizing erm with composite penalties this paper proposes a new pabased algorithm called increpa by incorporating pa approximation into an incremental gradient framework the proposed method is a more optimal pabased method that features lower periteration cost a faster convergence rate for convex composite penalties and guaranteed convergence for even nonconvex composite penalties experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in optimizing convex and nonconvex erm with composite penalties
nutrition research is in the process of addressing a series of questions related to the future of diet and health are all humans the same with respect to their response to diet? if not humans must be fed differently according to the differences in their genetics and metabolic needs are those differences selfevident to the individual or their caregivers? if not methods must be developed to measure the basis of differences between humans are the current sets of diagnostic biomarkers for disease appropriate and sufficient to distinguish the appropriate diets of humans for optimal metabolic health? if not metabolites must be measured such that the differences in human metabolism are resolvable before they become diseased will a small subset of metabolic markers provide an indication of intended and unintended effects of diets that relate to overall metabolism? if not comprehensive metabolic analyses metabolomics must be put in place to ensure that all aspects of health are accurately assessed inappropriate dietary choices are accelerating the development of chronic metabolic disease and threatening to overwhelm public health's ability to manage them nutrition and food sciences will need to collaborate with other scientific disciplines to develop and implement metabolic assessment technologies and to assemble annotated databases of metabolite profiles in humans thus building the knowledge needed to link metabolism to diet and health biochemical and physiological research must be guided to define the mechanisms by which diet interacts with metabolism in different individuals integrating metabolism with the genetic and dietary variables that affect health is the role of nutrition sciences integrating personal nutritional value with food's other key values of safety quality comfort delight convenience and affordability is the role of food science it is time for these two fields to address a common problem metabolic health with coordinated solutions
chemoheterotrophic denitrification technologies using woodchips as a solid carbon source ie wood chip bioreactors have been widely trialed for treatment of diffusesource agricultural nitrogen pollution there is growing interest in the use of this simple relatively lowcost biological wastewater treatment option in waters with relatively higher total suspended solids tss and chemical oxygen demand cod such as aquaculture wastewater this work: 1 evaluated hydraulic retention time hrt impacts on cod/tss removal and 2 assessed the potential for woodchip clogging under this wastewater chemistry four pilotscale woodchip denitrification bioreactors operated for 267 d showed excellent tss removal >90% which occurred primarily near the inlet and that cod removal was maximized at lower hrts eg 56% removal efficiency and 25 g of cod removed per m 3 of bioreactor per data 24 h hrt however influent wastewater took progressively longer to move into the woodchips likely due to a combination of 1 woodchip settling 2 clogging due to removed wastewater solids and/or accumulated bacterial growth and 3 the pulsed flow system pushing the chips away from the inlet the bioreactor that received the highest loading rate experienced the most altered hydraulics statistically significant increases in woodchip p content over time in woodchip bags placed near the bioreactor outlets 003 vs 010%p2o5 and along the bioreactor floor 004 vs 012%p2o5 confirmed wastewater solids were being removed and may pose a concern for subsequent nutrient mineralization and release nevertheless the excellent nitratenitrogen and tss removal along with notable cod removal indicated woodchip bioreactors are a viable water treatment technology for these types of wastewaters given they are used downstream of a filtration device c 2016 the authors published by elsevier ltd
publickey infrastructure pki is based on publickey certificates and is the most widely used mechanism for trust and key management however standard pki validation and revocation mechanisms are considered major reasons for its unsuitability for delay/disruption tolerant networking dtn dtn requires mechanism to authenticate messages at each node before forwarding it in the network so certificate revocation lists crls being distributed in dtn network will need to be authenticated and validated for issuer certificate authority ca at each node in this study the authors propose new validation and revocation mechanism which is compliant with dtn semantics and protocols this study also proposes a new design for crl in compliance with standard pki x509 standard to make the proposed mechanism easy to implement for dtn the new designed crl is of reduced size as it contains fewer entries as compared with standard x509 crl and also arranges the revocation list in the form of hash table map to increase the searching efficiency
we propose multiparty quantum summation protocols based on single particles in which participants are allowed to compute the summation of their inputs without the help of a trusted third party and preserve the privacy of their inputs only one participant who generates the source particles needs to perform unitary operations and only single particles are needed in the beginning of the protocols
residence times and connectivity are computed for 12 subregions in an urban manmade lake in china using a highresolution tracertransport model the renewal timescales are explicitly defined and computed for two groups of four freshwater inflow scenarios related to water diversion projects first the timescale values are computed and compared using different computational criteria for the upper limit of integration in the residence time equation the sensitivity analysis suggests that a calculation time of 300 days is necessary to satisfy the relative error 0001 and 5 % cutoff value criteria secondly the residence times can range from 15 to 102 and 10 to 66 days under low and high flow conditions respectively water in the inner lake would reside in the lake for less than 66 days prior to exiting the region of interest the timescale values can be applied to impact studies that investigate the extent of sudden water pollution events that initially affect a subdomain of a lake finally the lacustrine residence times are decomposed into the different subregion residence times resulting in a connectivity matrix this matrix can illustrate preferential connections among the individual subregions and reveal hidden patterns relating to local hydrodynamics in the lake
pharmacy is required to shift toward human service such as hearing the complaints of health but the study about helpseeking behavior to pharmacist is not really investigated we hypothesized that a decrease in expression visibility due to pharmacists' typical masks may negatively impact helpseeker' trust in pharmacist the sample included 100 drugstore customers aged >18 years participants were stratified by gender and randomly assigned to two groups: evaluation of clearmasked and normalmasked pharmacists after viewing a video with either male or female pharmacists wearing either clear or normal masks participants completed a questionnaire the primary outcome was trust in pharmacist measured by the trust scale and the secondary outcome was impression of the pharmacist measured by nineteen pairs of adjectives there were no differences by gender on trust scores results revealed that both male and female pharmacists who wore clear masks were rated as more trustworthy than normalmasked pharmacists p<0001 d0903 and p0001 d0716 respectively sixteen of nineteen adjectives reported for pharmacists wearing normal masks indicated greater negative intention than those with clear masks d04311469 in most cases among pharmacists wearing clear masks results showed positive correlations between trust and each impression adjective r02790710 our findings indicate that pharmacists wearing normal masks which partially hide facial expressions may decrease customer's trust in pharmacist further normal masks were associated with negative impression to avoid the inhibition of helpseek behavior we recommend that pharmacists wear a clear mask and increase nonverbal communication
lowcost highperformance vision sensors in conjunction with aerial sensing platforms are providing new possibilities for achieving autonomous visual inspection in civil engineering structures a large volume of images of a given structure can readily be collected for use in visual inspection overcoming spatial and temporal limitations associated with humanbased inspection although researchers have explored several algorithms and techniques for visionbased inspection in recent decades a major challenge in past implementations lies in dealing with a high volume of images while only a small fraction of them are important for actual inspection because processing irrelevant images can generate a significant number of falsepositives automated visual inspection techniques should be used in coordination with methods to localize relevant regions on the images when combined automated visual inspection will be able to meet the objectives and quality of human visual inspection to enable this technology we develop and validate a novel automated image localization technique to extract regions of interest rois on each of the images before utilizing visionbased damage detection techniques rois are the portions of an image that contain the physical region of the structure that is targeted for visual interrogation denoted as the targeted region of interest tri rois are computed based on the geometric relationship between the collected images and the tris analysis of such highly relevant and localized images would enable efficient and reliable visual inspection we successfully demonstrate the capability of the technique to extract the rois using a fullscale highway sign structure in the case where weld connections serve as the tris
parents are real beneficiaries of school services their involvement in school based activities has changed the role breadth of teachers schools can handle this parental involvement through the extrarole behaviors of teachers these beyond the job behaviors or organizational citizenship behaviors ocb of teachers are crucial for the schools despite the prescribed roles and duties the schools cannot predict and infer through formally stated inrole job description the entire range of extrarole behavior exhibited by teachers during and after school in this study teacher's role breadth is examined under the broad spectrum of organizational citizenship behavior ocb which resulted into a conceptual model on the determinants of teacher's ocb a qualitative evaluation grounded theory of 40 interviews has been conducted with all the stakeholders of school in india viz principals fellowteachers students and parents the most striking finding is that teachers are displaying prosocial behavior teacher's ocb is found to have three determinantsocbindividual ocborganization and ocbprosocial involvement of parents in school are redesigning and affecting the actions of teacher further the implications and directions for future research have also been discussed
twodimensional analytical and numerical solutions for determining the geometric dimensions and stresses of geotextile tubes are reviewed conventional onedimensional 1d approximation of the average drop in height consolidated height of geotextile tubes was also reviewed in this study densification modeling of the fill material based on arealstrain analysis is introduced leshchinky et al's approximation method considers only the vertical movement of the densifying material in the analysis the arealstrain method offers an alternative analysis approach wherein both the vertical and lateral movements of the densifying fill material are considered the geotextile tube is assumed to be resting on a rigid horizontal foundation and analyses for both filling and densified stages treats the internal material as liquid in order to apply normal pressure to the tube parametric cases for the densification of geotextile tube fill are presented results show that the degree of tube height reduction decreases as the density of the slurry fill is increased largescale tests have been conducted on composite geotextile tubes made of outer woven and inner nonwoven polyester pet material the tubes were 10 m and 25 m long having theoretical diameters of 30 m and 50 m respectively the validity of the solution for densification analysis was demonstrated by comparing the numerical results to those of the field test the agreement between the numerical results and field measurement data is fairly acceptable c 2015 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

we investigated theory of mind tom deficits in alzheimer's disease ad and its possible connection to autobiographical memory abm patients and matched controls were evaluated and compared using a videobased tom test an autobiographical fluency task and a neuropsychological test battery we found that tom deficits were positively associated with semantic abm in the clinical group whereas a positive relationship appeared between tom and episodic abm in controls we hypothesize that this reflects the course of the disease as well as that semantic abm is used for tom processing being still accessible in ad furthermore we assume that it is also less efficient which in turn leads to a specific deficit profile of social cognition
recent studies provided evidence for an impact of social relations on preschool children's sharing behavior children have been shown to be more generous towards friends than nonfriends or strangers as evidence comes largely from studies with western children little is known about crosscultural differences and commonalities in this pattern here we show that preschool and elementary school aged ugandan children show high levels of generosity independent of the social relationships with the recipient this finding points to societal differences in early sharing the results are discussed in terms of a formative impact of cultural traditions on the early development of sharing in the preschool years

the pyrenean desman galemys pyrenaicus is a small semiaquatic mammal endemic to the pyrenean mountains and the northern half of the iberian peninsula where it lives in cold and welloxygenated flowing mountain streams this species is currently classified as vulnerable on the iucn red list and has been undergoing habitat loss and fragmentation for decades inevitably impacting its distribution a recent genetic study based on mitochondrial and intronic sequences showed that the genetic variability of the pyrenean desman is very low in the pyrenees in this study we investigated the potential existence of genetic structure and gene flow at a smaller scale using 24 polymorphic microsatellite loci as the pyrenean desman is a very elusive species we supplemented our tissue sample collection with samples of feces collected in the french range of this species we successfully identified 70 individuals based on 355 fecal samples bayesian analyses revealed 3 genetic and geographic clusters 1 eastern 1 central and 1 western including 3 genetic subclusters with origins tracing back only 200 years these clusters were characterized by low levels of genetic diversity and high inbreeding coefficients although gene flow among clusters appeared to be limited populations seem to have exchanged alleles recently therefore connectivity between watersheds should be enhanced to maintain genetic diversity and potentially improve the longterm survival of the pyrenean desman in france
due to the everincreasing efficiency of computer systems symmetric cryptosystem are becoming more vulnerable to linear cryptanalysis brute force attacks for example des with its short key 56 bits is becoming easier to break while aes has a much longer key size up to 256 bits which makes it very difficult to crack using even the most advanced dedicated cryptanalysis computers however more complex algorithms which exhibit better confusion and diffusion characteristics are always required such algorithms must have stronger resistance against differential and linear cryptanalysis attacks this paper describes the development of an algorithm that implements a pseudo random number generator prng in order to increase the key generation complexity experimental results on both des and aes cryptosystems complemented with the prng have shown an average improvement of up to 363% in the avalanche error computation over the original standard systems which is a considerable improvement in the time complexity of both systems
background: pertussis infection can be severe in unvaccinated infants a casecontrol study was conducted to investigate the potential role of breastfeeding in protecting young unvaccinated infants from pertussis methods: hospitalized infants <6 months of age with positive real time polymerase chain reaction for pertussis on nasopharyngeal aspirate were enrolled as cases; healthy controls were enrolled among patients admitted for ultrasound screening vaccinated infants were excluded sociodemographic clinical and feeding information were collected the effect of breastfeeding on pertussis was investigated through multivariable analysis breast milk and blood samples were obtained from mothers of patients iga and bacterial binding against bordetella pertussis and other bacteria were tested in breast milk igg against pertussis toxin pt was tested in serum results: we enrolled 296 patients 61 cases and 235 controls exclusive breastfeeding was not associated with pertussis compared with partial breastfeeding/artificial feeding odds ratio: 12; 95% confidence interval ci : 031467 children with siblings were at higher risk for pertussis odds ratio: 25; 95% ci: 121535 iga against pertussis antigens were not higher in cases iga antipt median 024 optical density compared with controls iga antipt median 021 optical density though bacterial binding to b pertussis measured in breast milk was higher in cases median 435% compared with controls median 28%; p 0004 bacterial binding to b pertussis was low compared with other pathogens igg titers were higher in mothers of cases but no correlation was found between serum igg and breast milk iga conclusion: breastfeeding remains a mainstay of prevention for numerous diseases though it does not seem to play a role against pertussis alternative strategies to protect unvaccinated infants from pertussis should be considered

human activity recognition har is an important part of ambient intelligence systems since it can provide usercontext information thus allowing a greater personalization of services one of the problems with har systems is that the labeling process for the training data is costly which has hindered its practical application a common approach is to train a general model with the aggregated data from all users the problem is that for a new target user this model can perform poorly because it is biased towards the majority type of users and does not take into account the particular characteristics of the target user to overcome this limitation a userdependent model can be trained with data only from the target user that will be optimal for this particular user; however this requires a considerable amount of labeled data which is cumbersome to obtain in this work we propose a method to build a personalized model for a given target user that does not require large amounts of labeled data our method uses data already labeled by a community of users to complement the scarce labeled data of the target user our results showed that the personalized model outperformed the general and the userdependent models when labeled data is scarce
the development of a new material designed to trap heavy metals from sediments or wastewater based on a polypropylene nonwoven covalently grafted with cysteine has been reported in a previous paper part a the nonwoven was first functionalized with acrylic acid aa which is used as spacer and then cysteine was immobilized on the substrate through covalent coupling in order to obtain the socalled ppgaacysteine some preliminary heavy metals adsorption tests gave interesting results: at 20 degrees c for 24 h and in a 1000 mg/l heavy metals solution ppgaacysteine adsorbs 95 mg cu/g pp cuso4 solution 104 mg cu/g pp cu no3 2 solution 135 mg pb/g pp pb no3 2 solution and 21 mg cr/g pp cr no3 3 solution in this second part of the work heavy metals sorption tests were carried out with cu ii pb ii and cr iii separately in order to determine the sorption capacity of this new sorbent as a function of i the heavy metals concentration in the solution ii the contact time with the solution iii the ph and iv the ionic strength of the solution containing heavy metals moreover the sorption capacity of ppgaacysteine was studied using a polluted solution consisting of a mixture of these different heavy metals an electron paramagnetic resonance study was finally carried out in order to determine the coordination geometry in the environment of the copper trapped by the ppgaacysteine c 2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
women are still underrepresented at the highest management levels the thinkmanagerthinkmale phenomenon suggests that leadership is associated with male rather than female attributes although styling has been shown to influence the evaluation of women's leadership abilities the relevant specific features have been left remarkably unaddressed in a 2x2x2x2 skirt/pants with/without jewelry loose hair/braid with/without makeup betweensubjects design 354 participants evaluated a woman in a photograph women with makeup pants or with jewelry were rated as more competent than women without makeup with skirts or without jewelry a combination of loose hair and no makeup was perceived as warmest and women with loose hair were more likely to be hired than those with braids in sum even subtle changes in styling have a strong impact on how women's leadership abilities are evaluated
objective: leptin the product of the ob gene is a hormone secreted by adipocytes this study aimed to measure serum concentrations of leptin in normal weight subjects body mass index between 18 and 25 and obese subjects body mass index greater than or equal to 30 it is designed to support an important role for leptin in human metabolism and obesity methods: one hundred lean subjects aged 3316 +/ 1247 years and 193 obese subjects aged 386 +/ 135 years and 73 obese noninsulin dependent diabetes aged 519 +/ 96 years were included in the study where as obesity was defined as a body mass index greater than or equal to 30 serum leptin concentrations were measured using a newly developed radioimmunoassay results: the mean +/ sd serum leptin concentrations were 2599 +/ 154 ng per milliliter in the obese subjects and 584 +/ 527 ng per milliliter in the normal weight subjects p less than or equal to 0001 serum leptin concentrations in specimens from lean and obese adults correlated directly with body mass index body mass index; kg/m 2 r 074 p less than or equal to 0001 correlations were significantly improved by separating results by gender men r 085 women r 072; p less than or equal to 0001 conclusions: these findings showed large differences between leptin concentrations in normal and obese subjects; a progressive increase in leptin concentration with increasing body mass index these results strongly support an important role for leptin in human metabolism and obesity leptin may simply reflect the size of adipose tissue stores
we investigated the proposal that ankylosing spondylitis as is associated with unusual erap1 genotypes erap1 haplotypes were constructed for 213 as cases and 46 rheumatoid arthritis controls using family data haplotypes were generated from five common erap1 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps rs2287987 m349v rs30187 k528r rs10050860 d575n rs17482078 r725q and rs27044 q730e haplotype frequencies were compared using fisher's exact test erap1 haplotypes imputed from the international genetics of as consortium igas immunochip study were also studied in the family study we identified only four common erap1 haplotypes vrnqe mkdrq mrdre and mkdre in both as cases and controls apart from two rare <05% previously unreported haplotypes there were no examples of the unusual erap1 haplotype combination *001/*005 previously reported by others in 53% of as cases as expected k528bearing haplotypes were increased in the as family study as 43% vs control 35% due particularly to an increase in the mkdrq haplotype as 35% vs control 25% p 001 this trend was replicated in the imputed immunochip data for the two k528bearing haplotypes mkdrq as 33% vs controls 27% p 12 x 10 24 and mkdre as 8% vs controls 7% p 0004 the erap1 association with as is therefore predominantly attributable to common erap1 haplotypes and haplotype combinations
introduction: gesture is integrally linked with language and cognitive systems and recent years have seen a growing attention to these movements in patients with schizophrenia to date however there have been no investigations of gesture in youth at ultra high risk uhr for psychosis examining gesture in uhr individuals may help to elucidate other widely recognized communicative and cognitive deficits in this population and yield new clues for treatment development method: in this study mismatch indicating semantic incongruency between the content of speech and a given gesture and retrieval used during pauses in speech while a person appears to be searching for a word or idea gestures were evaluated in 42 uhr individuals and 36 matched healthy controls cognitive functions relevant to gesture production ie speed of visual information processing and verbal production as well as positive and negative symptomatologies were assessed results: although the overall frequency of cases exhibiting these behaviors was low uhr individuals produced substantially more mismatch and retrieval gestures than controls the uhr group also exhibited significantly poorer verbal production performance when compared with controls in the patient group mismatch gestures were associated with poorer visual processing speed and elevated negative symptoms while retrieval gestures were associated with higher speed of visual informationprocessing and verbal production but not symptoms conclusions: taken together these findings indicate that gesture abnormalities are present in individuals at high risk for psychosis while mismatch gestures may be closely related to disease processes retrieval gestures may be employed as a compensatory mechanism c 2014 elsevier bv all rights reserved
fipronil 5 amino1 2 6dichloro4 trifluoromethyl phenyl 4 trifluoromethyl sulfinyl 1hpyrazole3carbonitrile is a highly active broad spectrum insecticide from the phenyl pyrazole family which targets the gammaamino butyric acid gaba receptor although fipronil is presently widely used as an insecticide and acaricide little information is available with respect to its metabolic fate and disposition in mammals this study was designed to investigate the in vitro human metabolism of fipronil and to examine possible metabolic interactions that fipronil may have with other substrates fipronil was incubated with human liver microsomes hlm and several recombinant cytochrome p450 cyp isoforms obtained from bd biosciences hplc was used for metabolite identification and quantification fipronil sulfone was the predominant metabolite via cyp oxidation the k and vmax values for human liver microsomes are 272 mum and 011 nmol/mg protein min respectively; for rat liver microsomes rlm the km and vmax are 199 mum and 039 nmol/mg protein min respectively cyp3a4 is the major isoform responsible for fipronil oxidation in humans while cyp2c19 is considerably less active other human cyp isoforms have minimal or no activity toward fipronil coexpression of cytochrome b 5 b5 is essential for cyp3a4 to manifest high activity toward fipronil ketoconazole a specific inhibitor of cyp3a4 inhibits 78% of the hlm activity toward fipronil at a concentration of 2 mum oxidative activity toward fipronil in 19 singledonor hlms correlated well with their ability to oxidize testosterone the interactions of fipronil and other cyp3a4 substrates such as testosterone and diazepam were also investigated fipronil metabolism was activated by testosterone in hlm but not in cyp3a4 supersomes r testosterone 6betahydroxylation in hlm was inhibited by fipronil fipronil inhibited diazepam demethylation but had little effect on diazepam hydroxylation the results suggest that fipronil has the potential to interact with a wide range of xenobiotics or endogenous chemicals that are cyp3a4 substrates and that fipronil may be a useful substrate for the characterization of cyp3a4 in hlm c 2004 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
recently several articles cullmann 2012; agrell et al 2014; filippini and orea 2014; llorca et al 2014 address the issue of benchmarking decision making units with different technologies by using latent class models this method groups units that have similar technology for better comparison under this scheme there are two implicit assumptions: first that each class reflects a unique technology where its elements are not outliers second classes are assumed to be stationary and fixed if this assumption is violated the classification is transient and timedependent inadequate for the regulatory use suggested in the seminal papers we apply latent class models to classify swedish electricity distributors under different specifications in most of the models we identify one large class with approximately 784% of the dmu's and two small classes with 74% and 142% respectively moreover most of small classes elements switch between categories we contrast our parametric results with nonparametric outlier detector methods and find a relationship between identified outliers and the elements of smaller residual classes we believe that our work is an important caveat to the adoption of latent class modelling as an alternative or remedy for conventional models relying on a homogeneous reference set
we study geometric and topological properties of the image of a smooth submanifold of under a bilipschitz map to in particular we characterize how the dimension diameter volume and reach of the embedded manifold relate to the original our main result establishes a lower bound on the reach of the embedded manifold in the case where and the bilipschitz map is linear we discuss implications of this work in signal processing and machine learning where bilipschitz maps on lowdimensional manifolds have been constructed using randomized linear operators
in this paper we focus on resource conservation in a model of decentralized management of groundwater and rainwater we show that a conservation policy may have opposite effects on the level of the resource depending on the outcome of the decentralized management more precisely we consider identical farmers who can use two water resources groundwater and/or rainwater and we study the symmetric and asymmetric feedback stationary nash equilibria of the dynamic game we show that a subsidy on the use of rainwater may increase the level of the aquifer at the symmetric equilibrium whereas it decreases the level of the aquifer at the asymmetric equilibrium this suggests that the usual focus on interior symmetric equilibria in dynamic games may provide misleading policy implications
introduction: emotion recognition a social cognition domain is impaired in people with schizophrenia and contributes to social dysfunction whether impaired emotion recognition emerges as a manifestation of illness or predates symptoms is unclear findings from studies of emotion recognition impairments in firstdegree relatives of people with schizophrenia are mixed and to our knowledge no studies have investigated the link between emotion recognition and social functioning in that populationmethods: this study examined facial affect recognition and social skills in 16 offspring of parents with schizophrenia familial highrisk/fhr compared to 34 age and sexmatched healthy controls hc ages 719results: as hypothesised fhr children exhibited impaired overall accuracy accuracy in identifying fearful faces and overall recognition speed relative to controls ageadjusted facial affect recognition accuracy scores predicted parent's overall rating of their child's social skills for both groupsconclusions: this study supports the presence of facial affect recognition deficits in fhr children importantly as the first known study to suggest the presence of these deficits in young asymptomatic fhr children it extends findings to a developmental stage predating symptoms further findings point to a relationship between early emotion recognition and social skills improved characterisation of deficits in fhr children could inform early intervention
background: genomic selection gs uses information from genomic signatures consisting of thousands of genetic markers to predict complex traits as such gs represents a promising approach to accelerate tree breeding which is especially relevant for the genetic improvement of boreal conifers characterized by long breeding cycles in the present study we tested gs in an advancedbreeding population of the boreal black spruce picea mariana mill bsp for growth and wood quality traits and concurrently examined factors affecting gs model accuracy results: the study relied on 734 25yearold trees belonging to 34 fullsib families derived from 27 parents and that were established on two contrasting sites genomic profiles were obtained from 4993 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps representative of as many gene loci distributed among the 12 linkage groups common to spruce gs models were obtained for four growth and wood traits validation using independent sets of trees showed that gs model accuracy was high related to trait heritability and equivalent to that of conventional pedigreebased models in forward selection gains per unit of time were three times higher with the gs approach than with conventional selection in addition models were also accurate across sites indicating little genotypebyenvironment interaction in the area investigated using information from halfsibs instead of fullsibs led to a significant reduction in model accuracy indicating that the inclusion of relatedness in the model contributed to its higher accuracies about 500 to 1000 markers were sufficient to obtain gs model accuracy almost equivalent to that obtained with all markers whether they were well spread across the genome or from a single linkage group further confirming the implication of relatedness and potential longrange linkage disequilibrium ld in the high accuracy estimates obtained only slightly higher model accuracy was obtained when using marker subsets that were identified to carry large effects indicating a minor role for shortrange ld in this population conclusions: this study supports the integration of gs models in advancedgeneration tree breeding programs given that high genomic prediction accuracy was obtained with a relatively small number of markers due to high relatedness and family structure in the population in boreal spruce breeding programs and similar ones with long breeding cycles much larger gain per unit of time can be obtained from genomic selection at an early age than by the conventional approach gs thus appears highly profitable especially in the context of forward selection in species which are amenable to mass vegetative propagation of selected stock such as spruces
every cognitive process including the conceptualization of some perceived facts such as human disease states entails both an emotional as an evaluative aspect regarding this crosscultural research has shown that there are common human value contents therefore in a human phylogenetic context it is plausible to argue that along with the development of our language both the heteroperception and selfperception of some specific human states have been termed descriptively to communicate their adaptive significance this is the case of those human states whose properties have been conceptualized with the corresponding evaluative emotional component as disease since names are the symbols of a language that designate any type of object either perceptual or conceptual reviewing the etymology of terms related to disease could be a contribution to its elucidation in consequence some equivalent terms to the spanish word enfermedad were reviewed in various indoeuropean and nonindoeuropean languages from the analyzed denominations we can conclude that the different words have described the perception of human conditions as weak evil suffering states etc therefore there is a denotative concordance with the diseased human states in the revised cultures
the northeastern region of india although rich in land and water resources often suffers from a waterscarce situation particularly during the nonrainy season the steep terrain conditions do not support conventional irrigation systems and therefore microirrigation system needs to be promoted in microirrigation systems maintaining uniformity of application is necessary to achieve a satisfactory crop yield maintaining the system hydraulics is a challenge due to the terrain conditions and equipment available a study was conducted to observe various uniformity parameters of selected emitters at five different operating pressures viz 05 075 10 125 and 15 kg cm 2 in the study it was observed that the discharge variation of the selected emitters was between 87 and 397% the uniformity coefficient varied from 09 to 166 where the distribution uniformity and statistical uniformity varied from 811 to 991% and 834991% respectively the emitter flow variation ranged from 003 to 049 in the range of 0515 kg cm 2 the emitter exponent indicated that the values ranged from 020 to 055 all these values were far from the manufacturer's value from the study we can interpret that the emitting system needs to be tested before adoption in the field to ensure uniformity of water application copyright c 2016 john wiley & sons ltd

mirror neurons mns are a fascinating class of cells originally discovered in the ventral premotor cortex pmv and subsequently in the inferior parietal lobule ipl of the macaque which become active during both the execution and observation of actions in this review i will first highlight the mounting evidence indicating that mirroring others' actions engages a broad system of reciprocally connected cortical areas which extends well beyond the classical iplpmv circuit and might even include subcortical regions such as the basal ganglia then i will present the most recent findings supporting the idea that the observation of one's own actions which might play a role in the ontogenetic origin and tuning of mns retains a particular relevance within the adult mn system finally i will propose that both cortical and subcortical mechanisms do exist to decouple mn activity from the motor output in order to render it exploitable for highorder perceptual cognitive and even social functions the findings reviewed here provide an original framework for envisaging the main challenges and experimental directions of future neurophysiological and neuroanatomical studies of the monkey mn system
past research has established clear support for the prosocial function of gratitude in improving the wellbeing of others the present research provides evidence for another hypothesized function of gratitude: the social alignment function which enhances the tendency of grateful individuals to follow social norms we tested the social alignment hypothesis of gratitude in 2 studies with large samples using 2 different conformity paradigms participants were subjected to a color judgment task experiment 1 and a material consumption task experiment 2 they were provided with information showing choices allegedly made by others but were allowed to state their responses in private supporting the social alignment hypothesis the results showed that induced gratitude increased private conformity specifically participants induced to feel gratitude were more likely to conform to the purportedly popular choice even if the option was factually incorrect experiment 1 this effect appears to be specific to gratitude; induction of joy produced significantly less conformity than gratitude experiment 2 we discuss whether the social alignment function provides a behavioral pathway in the role of gratitude in building social relationships

the current study measured adults' p350 and n170 erps while they interacted with a character in a virtual reality paradigm some participants believed the character was controlled by a human avatar condition n19 ; others believed it was controlled by a computer program agent condition n19 in each trial participants initiated joint attention in order to direct the character's gaze toward a target in 50% of trials the character gazed toward the target congruent responses and in 50% of trials the character gazed to a different location incongruent response in the avatar condition the character's incongruent gaze responses generated significantly larger p350 peaks at centroparietal sites than congruent gaze responses in the agent condition the p350 effect was strikingly absent left occipitotemporal n170 responses were significantly smaller in the agent condition compared to the avatar condition for both congruent and incongruent gaze shifts these data suggest that beliefs about human agency may recruit mechanisms that discriminate the social outcome of a gaze shift after approximately 350ms and that these mechanisms may modulate the early perceptual processing of gaze these findings also suggest that the ecologically valid measurement of social cognition may depend upon paradigms that simulate genuine social interactions

recent demographic changes in the forestowner structure are suspected to have led to the increasing number of owners with no specific objectives for their forests in addition the continuous fragmentation of the forest holdings has increased the threat of the passiveness related to forest management to decrease the tendency towards passiveness new policy tools and initiatives have been suggested in the finnish context the idea of an investorbased jointly owned forest has been introduced as facilitating the effective utilization of the forest resource however collective ownership has faced prejudice and scepticism among private forest owners in order to expand the forest owners need to see the idea of jointly owned forests as a socially legitimate thus by adopting van leeuwen's framework for analyzing the legitimation of new social practices we examine how finnish forest owners legitimate their participation in jointly owned forests the qualitative data of the study consist of 20 indepth interviews with private forest owners who have joined a jointly owned forest our study contributes to the recent discussion on jointly owned forests we show how a change in the type of ownership results in moral authoritative and rational justifications over the decision while simultaneously renewing the identity of the forest owner accordingly we suggest that forest ownership is not only driven by rational prospects but the moral and emotional nature of ownership should be better taken into account at the policy level and in structural designs when discussing the promotion of new types of forest ownership
genetic analyses can provide information about human evolutionary history that cannot always be gleaned from other sources we evaluated evidence of selective pressure due to introduced infectious diseases in the genomes of two indigenous southern african san groupsthe double dagger khomani who had abundant contact with other people migrating into the region and the more isolated ju vertical bar'hoansi we used a dual approach to test for increased selection on immune genes compared with the rest of the genome in these groups first we calculated summary values of statistics that measure genomic signatures of adaptation to contrast selection signatures in immune genes and all genes second we located regions of the genome with extreme values of three selection statistics and examined these regions for enrichment of immune genes we found stronger and more abundant signals of selection in immune genes in the double dagger khomani than in the ju vertical bar'hoansi we confirm this finding within each population to avoid effects of different demographic histories of the two populations we identified eight immune genes that have potentially been targets of strong selection in the double dagger khomani whereas in the juj'hoansi no immune genes were found in the genomic regions with the strongest signals of selection we suggest that the more abundant signatures of selection at immune genes in the double dagger khomani could be explained by their more frequent contact with immigrant groups which likely led to increased exposure and adaptation to introduced infectious diseases
at birth the piglet's immune system is immature and it is dependent upon passive maternal protection until weaning the piglet's mucosal immune system develops over the first few weeks but has not reached maturity at weaning ages which are common on commercial farms at weaning piglets are presented with a vast and diverse range of microbial and dietary/environmental antigens their ability to distinguish between antigens and mount a protective response to potential pathogens and to develop tolerance to dietary antigens is critical to their survival and failure to do so is reflected in the high incidence of morbidity and mortality in the postweaning period a growing recognition that the widespread use of antibiotics to control infection during this critical period should be controlled has led to detailed studies of those factors which drive the development of the mucosal immune system the role of gut microbiota in driving this process the origin of the bacteria that colonise the young piglet's intestine and the impact of rearing environment this review briefly describes how the mucosal immune system is equipped to respond appropriately to antigenic challenge and the programmed sequence by which it develops the results of studies on the critical interplay between the host immune system and gut microbiota are discussed along with the effects of rearing environment by comparing these with results from human studies on the development of allergies in children an approach to promote an earlier maturation of the piglet immune system to resist the challenges of weaning are outlined

renewable portfolio standards rpss are popular marketbased mechanisms for promoting development of renewable power generation however they are usually implemented without considering the capabilities and cost of transmission infrastructure we use singleand multistage planning approaches to find costeffective transmission and generation investments to meet single and multiyear rps goals respectively using a sixnode network and assuming a linearized dc power flow we examine how the lumpy nature of network reinforcements and kirchhoff's voltage law can affect the performance of rpss first we show how simplified planning approaches that ignore transmission constraints transmission lumpiness or kirchhoff's voltage law yield distorted estimates of the type and location of infrastructure as well as inaccurate compliance costs to meet the renewable goals second we illustrate how lumpy transmission investments and kirchhoff's voltage law result in compliance costs that are nonconvex with respect to the rps targets in the sense that the marginal costs of meeting the rps may decrease rather than increase as the target is raised thus the value of renewable energy certificates recs also depends on the network topology as does the amount of noncompliance with the rps if noncompliance is penalized but not prohibited finally we use a multistage planning model to determine the optimal generation and transmission infrastructure for rps designs that set multiyear goals we find that the optimal infrastructure to meet rps policies that are enforced yearbyyear differ from the optimal infrastructure if banking and borrowing is allowed in the rec market

the interleaved multilevel dcdc converters have advantages of low voltage stress of the switches and diodes and reduction of filter size particularly series input parallel output isop configuration is well suited for high output voltage and large output current application but input series output series isos configuration enable the utilization of low voltage rating switches in high voltage input and high voltage output applications that require galvanic isolation the series connection of the isolated dcdc converters at the input side also can be used for higher voltage application while multilevel topology offers many new features it also necessitates a balance control of the input capacitors the paper describes the operating principles of the balancing circuit analyzes the fundamental relationships introduces principles of the operation of the circuit the paper shows experimental results based on a few practical application examples the paper discusses design of the transformer with balancing winding for isop isos and parallel connection of the dcdc converters to provide independent voltage balancing of input capacitors
this study examined the impact of a selective anxiety prevention program for offspring of clinically anxious parents on three domains of child functioning: 1 social 2 familial and 3 emotional/behavioral dyads were randomized into either the coping and promoting strength program caps; n 70 or information monitoring im; n 66 comparison group multiinformant assessments were conducted at baseline post intervention and 6 and 12 months followups random effects mixed models under the linear growth modeling lgm framework was used to assess the impact of caps on growth trajectories over time children in the caps group had significantly lower anxiety anxious/depressed symptoms and lower total behavior problems parent report compared to children in im group the intervention did not impact other domains assessed eg social functioning which may be due to floor effects on these measures longitudinal followup data is needed to provide valuable information about this high risk population
the accurate location of eyes in a facial image is important to many human facial recognitionrelated applications and has attracted considerable research interest in computer vision however most prevalent methods are based on the frontal pose of the face where applying them to nonfrontal poses can yield erroneous results in this paper we propose an eye detection method that can locate the eyes in facial images captured at various head poses our proposed method consists of two stages: eye candidate detection and eye candidate verification in eye candidate detection eye candidates are obtained by using multiscale iris shape features and integral image the size of the iris in face images varies as the head pose changes and the proposed multiscale iris shape feature method can detect the eyes in such cases since it utilizes the integral image its computational cost is relatively low the extracted eye candidates are then verified in the eye candidate verification stage using a support vector machine svm based on the featurelevel fusion of a histogram of oriented gradients hog and cell mean intensity features we tested the performance of the proposed method using the chinese academy of sciences' pose expression accessories and lighting caspeal database and the pointing'04 database the results confirmed the superiority of our method over the conventional haarlike detector and two hybrid eye detectors under relatively extreme head pose variations c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
the studies presented in this article explored the relevance of death fears to obsessive compulsive disorder ocd in study 1 the relationships between death anxiety and a variety of markers of psychopathology were examined in 171 treatmentseeking participants with ocd moderate to large correlations between collettlester fear of death scale scores taken at initial assessment and clinical ratings of ocd severity number of hospitalizations number of medications and total number of lifetime anxietyrelated diagnoses identified in structured diagnostic interviews were obtained study 2 used the mortality salience ms paradigm to examine whether experimentally manipulated death cognitions exacerbate compulsive cleaning behaviors among ocd washers treatmentseeking participants with ocd 66 washers and 66 nonwashers were randomly allocated to either a ms or dental pain priming condition following priming participants completed a series of distraction tasks involving skin conductance recording before being offered an opportunity to wash conductive gel off their hands as hypothesized washers went to greater efforts in cleaning as measured by washing duration and soap and paper towel use than nonwashers similarly participants in the ms condition showed greater cleaning than those in the dental pain salience condition however these main effects were qualified by significant interactions for both washing duration and soap use as expected simple effect contrasts revealed that the effect of ms on cleaning behaviors was significant for washers but not for nonwashers clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed
geotextile filters can be used in several geotechnical and geoenvironmental applications regarding the protection of banks or slopes against erosion caused by the action of waves these materials can be employed under revetments and armour layers this paper presents results of large scale tests on armoured slopes where geotextile and granular filters were employed a wave flume was used in the tests and three types of nonwoven geotextiles and a conventional granular layer were employed as filters between the armour layer and the base soil slope the armoured slope was subjected to the impacts of waves produced by a wave generator opposite to the channel slope pore pressures in the soil slope were measured during the tests and soil particles that piped though the filters and that were entrapped in the geotextile were collected for total mass and particle diameter measurements the results obtained showed that the geotextile and the granular filters presented similar performance in addition retention criteria available for this type of geotextile filter application provided very conservative results the findings highlight the importance of the development of more accurate testing techniques and filter criteria for designing armoured slopes with geotextile filters c 2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the present study investigates the relative extent to which judgments of people's behavior are influenced by truth as measured by averaged observerjudgments and by systematic bias ie perceivers' preexisting views of target persons using data from online questionnaires and laboratory sessions n 155 we demonstrate that self and peerjudgments of people's actual behavior in specific situations are somewhat accurate but are also affected by what perceivers thought of the targets before observing their behavior the latter effect comprises a general evaluative component generally positive or negative views of targets and a contentspecific component views of targets in terms of specific characteristics for example restrained we also found that friends but not targets themselves tend to judge targets' behaviors more positively than unacquainted observers do the relevance of these findings for person perception in everyday life and in research contexts is discussed
lysosomal storage disorders lsds are inherited diseases characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and often showing a neurodegenerative course there is no cure to treat the central nervous system in lsds moreover the mechanisms driving neuronal degeneration in these pathological conditions remain largely unknown by studying mouse models of lsds we found that neurodegeneration develops progressively with profound alterations in presynaptic structure and function in these models impaired lysosomal activity causes massive perikaryal accumulation of insoluble synuclein and increased proteasomal degradation of cysteine string protein csp as a result the availability of both synuclein and csp at nerve terminals strongly decreases thus inhibiting soluble nsf attachment receptor snare complex assembly and synaptic vesicle recycling aberrant presynaptic snare phenotype is recapitulated in mice with genetic ablation of one allele of both csp and synuclein the overexpression of csp in the brain of a mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type iiia a severe form of lsd efficiently reestablished snare complex assembly thereby ameliorating presynaptic function attenuating neurodegenerative signs and prolonging survival our data show that neurodegenerative processes associated with lysosomal dysfunction may be presynaptically initiated by a concomitant reduction in synuclein and csp levels at nerve terminals they also demonstrate that neurodegeneration in lsds can be slowed down by reestablishing presynaptic functions thus identifying synapse maintenance as a novel potentially druggable target for brain treatment in lsds
computer visionbased human activity recognition har has become very famous these days due to its applications in various fields such as smart home healthcare for elderly people a videobased activity recognition system basically has many goals such as to react based on people's behavior that allows the systems to proactively assist them with their tasks a novel approach is proposed in this work for depth video based human activity recognition using jointbased motion features of depth body shapes and deep belief network dbn from depth video different body parts of human activities are segmented first by means of a trained random forest the motion features representing the magnitude and direction of each joint in next frame are extracted finally the features are applied for training a dbn to be used for recognition later the proposed har approach showed superior performance over conventional approaches on private and public datasets indicating a prominent approach for practical applications in smartly controlled environments
past research has shown that the gender typicality of applicants' faces affects leadership selection irrespective of a candidate's gender: a masculine facial appearance is congruent with masculinetyped leadership roles thus masculinelooking applicants are hired more certainly than femininelooking ones in the present study we extended this line of research by investigating hiring decisions for both masculineand femininetyped professional roles furthermore we used eye tracking to examine the visual exploration of applicants' portraits our results indicate that masculinelooking applicants were favored for the masculinetyped role leader and femininelooking applicants for the femininetyped role team member eye movement patterns showed that information about gender category and facial appearance was integrated during first fixations of the portraits hiring decisions however were not based on this initial analysis but occurred at a second stage when the portrait was viewed in the context of considering the applicant for a specific job
compared to the conventional order of hypocritical actionssaying one thing and then doing anothermerely reversing the order of these actions can mitigate whether an individual is judged to be a hypocrite barden rucker & petty 2005 the present research examines how factors extraneous to a target's own actionsspecifically group membershipinfluence hypocrisy judgments three experiments provided consistent evidence that reversing the order of statement and behavior mitigated hypocrisy judgments to a greater extent when observers judged ingroup targets compared to outgroup targets this pattern was observed across two distinct groups ie gender and political party in addition mediational evidence suggested that the greater mitigation for ingroup targets stemmed from the observer's greater tendency to make attributions that ingroup targets had genuinely changed for the better
one of the current challenges of persimmon postharvest research is the development of nondestructive methods that allow determination of the internal properties of the fruit such as maturity flesh firmness and astringency this study evaluates the usefulness of hyperspectral imaging in the 4601020 nm range as a nondestructive tool to achieve these aims in persimmon cv 'rojo brillante' which is an astringent cultivar fruit were harvested at three different stages of commercial maturity and exposed to different treatments of co2 95% co2 20 degrees c from 0 to 24 h in order to obtain fruit with different levels of astringency partial least square pls based methods were used to classify persimmon fruits by maturity and to predict flesh firmness from the average spectrum of each fruit the results showed a 979% rate of correct maturity classification and an r 2 p of 080 for firmness prediction with only five selected wavelengths for astringency assessment as our results showed that the soluble tannins that remain after co2 treatments are distributed irregularly inside the flesh a model based on pls was built using the spectrum of every pixel in the fruit the model obtained an r 2 p of 091 which allowed the creation of the predicted distribution maps of the tannins in the flesh of the fruit thereby pointing to hyperspectral systems as a promising technology to assess the effectiveness of the deastringency treatments that are usually applied before commercialising persimmons from astringent cultivars c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
a $600 million nutritional supplements market growing at 30% every year attests to consumer awareness of and interests in health benefits attributed to these supplements for over 80years the importance of polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa consumption for human health has been established the fda recently approved the use of 3 pufas in supplements additionally the market for 3 pufa ingredients grew by 243% last year which affirms their popularity and public awareness of their benefits pufas are essential for normal human growth; however only minor quantities of the beneficial 3 pufas eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha are synthesized by human metabolism rather pufas are obtained via dietary or nutritional supplementation and modified into other beneficial metabolites a vast literature base is available on the health benefits and biological roles of 3 pufas and their metabolism; however information on their dietary sources and palatability of foods incorporated with 3 pufas is limited dha and epa are added to many foods that are commercially available such as infant and pet formulae and they are also supplemented in animal feed to incorporate them in consumer dairy meat and poultry products the chief sources of epa and dha are fish oils or purified preparations from microalgae which when added to foods impart a fishy flavor that is considered unacceptable this fishy flavor is completely eliminated by extensively purifying preparations of n3 pufa sources while n3 pufa lipid autoxidation is considered the main cause of fishy flavor the individual oxidation products identified thus far such as unsaturated carbonyls do not appear to contribute to fishy flavor or odor alternatively various compound classes such as free fatty acids and volatile sulfur compounds are known to impart fishy flavor to foods identification of the causative compounds to reduce and eventually eliminate fishy flavor is important for consumer acceptance of pufafortified foods

soilgeosynthetic interface shear strength is an essential parameter for the design and stability analysis of geosyntheticreinforced soil structures economic and environmental reasons have led to increasing use of locally available residual soils with a significant percentage of fines and lower draining capacity when compared with the traditional goodquality backfill materials this paper describes an extensive laboratory study carried out using a largescale direct shear test device in which the influence of soil moisture content soil density and geosynthetic type on the direct shear behaviour of the soilgeosynthetic interface was evaluated the study involved a locally available granite residual soil and four geosynthetics: two geogrids one uniaxial and the other biaxial one geocomposite reinforcement highstrength geotextile and one geotextile test results have revealed that the increase in soil moisture content can measurably reduce the soilgeosynthetic interface shear strength regardless of soil moisture content soil density proved to have a remarkable influence on interface shear strength particularly when geogrids were used among the different geosynthetics tested the biaxial geogrid was found to be the most effective reinforcement for this particular type of soil concerning the direct shear mechanism for soilgeogrid interfaces the coefficients of interaction ranged from 071 to 099 for soilgeotextile interfaces the coefficients of interaction varied from 054 to 085
affective theory of mind tom is the specific ability to represent own and others' emotional states and feelings previous studies examined affective tom ability in patients with huntingtons disease hd using the reading the mind in the eyes test rmet results were consistent in showing difficulties in inferring complex mental states from photographs of people even in the early stage of hd however there has been no agreement as to whether or not cognitive impairments in hd population might have contributed to poor performance on the rmet test the aim of the present study was to assess whether the affective tom ability was impaired in the mild to moderate stages of hd and whether there was an association between compromised tom ability and the presence of cognitive impairment we evaluated tom by means of rmet and global cognitive functioning by means of the moca questionnaire in 15 hd patients and 15 healthy subjects hs both groups were matched for age and level of education our study showed that the ability to judge a persons mental states from a picture of their eyes was impaired in hd patients compared to normal population indeed hd subjects gave the 34% of correct responses on rmet whereas healthy control subjects percentage of correct responses was 71% furthermore this impairment was not correlated with global cognitive functioning except for the visuospatial task these results show that rmet might represent a valid instrument to assess affective tom ability in hd patients in the mild to moderate stages of the disease independently from their cognitive status since it is known that hd patients in addition to motor symptoms suffer from cognitive deficits including memory and executive impairments it is important to have an instrument which is not influenced by cognitive abilities it is possible therefore to use rmet to assess important aspects of hd patients such as their ability to recognize others emotions and feelings even when patients suffer from cognitive decline
past work on the political impact of racial diversity has focused on direct effects demonstrating that diverse environments are associated with more negativeor in some circumstances more positiveracial attitudes and racetargeted policy preferences we show that diversity functions in a second way as a variable that magnifies the political impact of individual differences in the psychological disposition of authoritarianism using a national sample we find that in white areas with minimal diversity authoritarianism had no impact on racial prejudice political intolerance and attitudes toward immigration as diversity rises however authoritarianism plays an increasingly dominant role in political judgment in diverse environments authoritarians become more racially ethnically and politically intolerant and nonauthoritarians less so we conceptually replicate these findings in a dorm setting with plausibly exogenous levels of local diversity and discuss the implications of our findings in terms of the various ways in which ethnoracial diversity structures political attitudes

acrylamide aa is a foodborne toxicant suspected to be carcinogenic to humans it is formed in the heating process of starchcontaining food currently there is a great discussion about the possible human health risks connected with the dietary uptake of acrylamide haemoglobin adducts of acrylamide and its oxidative metabolite glycidamide are both markers of biochemical effect however because glycidamide has a higher carcinogenic potency than acrylamide itself the glycidamide adduct might mirror the genotoxicity better than acrylamide adducts in order to gain more information about the human metabolism of acrylamide we investigated a small group of persons for the effective internal doses of acrylamide and glycidamide using haemoglobin adducts as parameters of biochemical effect the collective was subdivided into nonsmokers n 13 and smokers n 16 by determining the smokingspecific acrylonitrile haemoglobin adduct ncyanoethylvaline cev the mean values for the adducts of acrylamide n2carbamoylethylvaline aaval and glycidamide n r s 2hydroxy2carbamoylethylvaline gaval in nonsmokers was 19 pmol/g globin aaval range 7 31 pmol/g globin and 17 pmol/g globin gaval range 9 23 pmol/g globin for smokers mean levels of aaval were 80 pmol/g globin range: 25 199 pmol/g globin and those of gaval were 53 pmol/g globin range: 22 119 pmol/g globin metabolism to glycidamide turned out to be significantly more effective in nonsmokers than in the higher exposed smokers compared with studies in rats the metabolic conversion of acrylamide to glycidamide as measured by haemoglobin adducts seems to occur to a similar extent in humans as in rats risk estimations on acrylamide based on experimental data obtained in rats obviously did not overestimate the cancer risk for the general population furthermore our results might indicate that the doseresponse curve for acrylamide is not linear this would be in line with the results of animal experiments on rodents

an improved solution for drug distribution is presented in this paper it is divided into two parts: i a multioperator evolutionary algorithm in charge of calculating the initial delivery routes and ii an ambient intelligencebased support system able to tracing the merchandise along the distribution route the first one establishes the routes to be followed by the vehicles based on a proposal of estimation of the travel times the second one is formed by a system able to recognize and trace the drugs inside each vehicle a laboratory experimentation has been conducted in order to demonstrate the adequacy of the route calculator in addition a field experimentation has been carried out by implementing the traceability system in a delivery van which of the drug distributor in the city of bilbao note to practitionersmotivated by the specific needs found by a drug distributor in managing deliveries to pharmacies involved in its supply chain this paper considers an optimization problem as the proper way to model the particularities found in this scenario this paper proposes the use of a combinatorial optimization problem as the way to model problems due to the fact that distributor's clients are located in different cities the proposal considers travel times both between cities and inside the city in addition rush hours are also taken into account in order to provide a more realistic model finally a radio frequency identificationbased solution is proposed in order to implement traceability in the delivered products as well as to prevent human errors additionally in case an unavoidable error occurs the solution offers also an incident management mechanism
the paper draws upon the controversy over the use of indigenousrelated sports emblems that has recently sparked a series of protests across the united states against the washington redsk*ns name and imagery it focuses on the visual aspect of the debate tracing the whitesupremacist foundations of the washington team's insignia to the institutional construction of native identity through popular indian head pennies gold coins and buffalo nickels in the period between 1859 and 1938 pointing at the seemingly paradoxical discrepancy between the minted messages and the systematic political legal and military invasion on american indian sovereignty in that period it proceeds to deconstruct the paradox by exposing the numismatic pictorial language as a manifestation of the same ideological project and the configurations of power that have remained unchanged to this day the continued circulation of indigenousbased iconography in the contemporary american context shows that the same cultural imagination continues to serve not only as a powerful rationale for european america's historical national and political narrative but also as a form of anticonquest that both obscures and enacts the established formulas of colonial domination and control observing the alterations of the washington redsk*ns logo design across some of the key sociohistorical moments of the second half of the twentieth and the beginning of the twentyfirst century the analysis explores how various forms of national anxiety transcend into identity through the politics of representation in that light it regards recent activism against massmediated symbolization of indigenous identity as an important arena in which centuriesold hegemonic discourses are contested against new venues of selfdetermination and internal decolonization
web news articles are generated in continuous timevarying and rapid modes this environment causes an explosion of information which needs to be stored processed and analyzed conventional machine learning algorithms that are applied in the web news mining work in an offline environment cannot efficiently handle data streams in this paper we propose an evolving web news mining framework based on the recently published evolving type2 classifier et2class the et2class adopts an open structure that can be used in non stationary environments and works on a single pass learning mode that is applicable for online realtime applications the effectiveness of our evolving web news mining techniques is numerically validated and compared against stateoftheart algorithms the efficacy of our methodology has been numerically validated with real local australian news articles namely the age spanning from 26/2/2016 to 13/3/2016 and has been compared with 6 state of the art algorithms our algorithm outperforms other consolidated algorithms and achieves a tradeoff between complexity and accuracy with almost 10% improvement in term of complexity c 2016 published by elsevier bv

background: doctors' verbal and nonverbal communication skills have an impact on patients' health outcomes so it is important for medical students to develop these skills traditional nonverbal communication skills training can involve a tutor manually annotating a student's nonverbal behaviour during patientdoctor consultations but this is very timeconsuming teleconference systems have been used in verbal communication skills training methods: we describe eqclinic a system that enables verbal and nonverbal communication skills training during teleconsultations with simulated patients sps with evaluation exercises promoting reflection students and sps can have teleconsultations through the teleconsultation component in this component sps can provide feedback to students through a thumbsup/thumbsdown tool and a comments box eqclinic automatically analyses communication features in the recorded consultations such as facial expressions and provides graphical representations our 2015 pilot study investigated whether eqclinic helped students be aware of their nonverbal behaviour and improve their communication skills and evaluated the usability of the platform students received automated feedback and sp and tutor evaluations and then completed selfassessment and reflection questionnaires results: eight medical students and three sps conducted 13 teleconsultations using eqclinic more students paid attention to their nonverbal communication and students who were engaged in two consultations felt more confident in their second consultation students rated the system positively felt comfortable using it 59/7 and reported that the structure 54/7 and information 58/7 were clear this pilot provides evidence that eqclinic helps and positively influences medical students practise their communication skills with sps using a teleconference platform discussion: it is not easy to improve nonverbal communication skills in a short time period further evaluation of eqclinic with larger numbers will ascertain learning gains and application in health professional training developing a standard model for the assessment of nonverbal behaviour in teleconsultations and providing students with more valuable evaluation and suggestions are part of our future work
research on the visual and nonverbal aspects of political communication is experiencing a renaissance of sorts expanding the boundaries of an already innovative and dynamic branch of crossdisciplinary scholarship the articles assembled in this special issue represent the breadth of work now occurring at this vibrant crossroads of scholarly inquiry this introduction discusses each contribution while providing an overview of the entire issue
background: the actual connectivity between populations of freshwater organisms is largely determined by species biology but is also influenced by many areaand sitespecific factors such as water pollution and habitat fragmentation therefore the prediction of effective gene flow even for wellstudied organisms is difficult the amphipod crustacean gammarus fossarum is a key invertebrate in freshwater ecosystems and contains many cryptic species one of these species is the broadly distributed g fossarum clade 11 type b in this study we tested for factors driving the genetic structure of g fossarum clade 11 in a humanimpacted landscape at local and regional scales to determine population structure we analyzed the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 co1 gene of 2 086 specimens from 54 sampling sites and microsatellite loci of 420 of these specimens from ten sites results: we detected strong overall genetic differentiation between populations at regional and local scales with both independent marker systems often even within few kilometers interestingly we observed only a weak correlation of genetic distances with geographic distances or catchment boundaries testing for factors explaining the observed population structure revealed that it was mostly the colonization history which has influenced the structure rather than any of the chosen environmental factors whereas the number of instream barriers did not explain population differentiation the few large water reservoirs in the catchment likely act as dispersal barriers conclusions: we showed that populations of gammarus fossarum clade 11 are strongly isolated even at local scales in the humanimpacted region the observed genetic structure was best explained by the effects of random genetic drift acting independently on isolated populations after historical colonization events genetic drift in isolated populations was probably further enhanced by anthropogenic impacts as g fossarum is sensitive to many anthropogenic stressors these findings highlight the importance of smallscale genetic studies to determine barriers restricting gene flow to prevent further loss of genetic diversity and maintain intact freshwater ecosystems

cryptography via public key cryptosystems pkc has been widely used for providing services such as confidentiality authentication integrity and nonrepudiation other than security computational efficiency is another major issue of concern and for pkc it is largely controlled by either modular exponentiation or scalar multiplication operations such that found in rsa and elliptic curve cryptosystem ecc respectively one approach to address this operational problem is via concept of addition chain ac in which the exhaustive single operation involving large integer is reduced into a sequence of operations consisting of simple multiplications or additions existing techniques manipulate the representation of integer into binary and mary prior performing the series of operations this paper proposes an iterative variant of sliding window method swm form of mary family for shorter sequence of multiplications corresponding to the modular exponentiation thus it is called an iterative swm moreover specific for ecc that imposes no extra resource for point negation the paper proposes an iterative recoded swm operating on integers recoded using a modified nonadjacent form naf for speeding up the scalar multiplication the relative behaviour is also examined of number of additions in scalar multiplications with the integers hamming weight the proposed iterative swm methods reduce the number of operations by up to 6% than the standard swm heuristic they result to even shorter chains of operations than ones returned by many metaheuristic algorithms for the ac
the estimation of nutrient content of plants is considerably important in agricultural practices especially in enabling the application of precision farming a plethora of methods has been used to estimate nitrogen amount in plants including the utilization of computer vision however most of the imagebased nitrogen estimation methods are conducted in controlled environments these methods are not so practical time consuming and require many equipment therefore there is a crucial need to develop a method to estimate nitrogen content of plants based on leaves images captured on field it is a very challenging task since the intensity of sunlight is always changing and this leads to an inconsistent image capturing problem in this paper we develop a lowcost simple and accurate approach imagebased nitrogen amount estimation plant images are captured directly under sunlight by using a conventional digital camera and are subject to a variation in lighting conditions we propose a color constancy method using neural networks fusion and a genetic algorithm to normalize various plant images due to different sunlight intensities a macbeth color checker is utilized as the reference to normalize the color of the images we also develop a combination of neural networks using a committee machine to estimate the nitrogen content in wheat leaves twelve statistical rgb color features are used as the input parameters for the nutrient estimation the obtained result shows considerable better performance than the conventional grayworld and scalebymax approaches as well as linear model and single neural network methods finally we show that our nutrient estimation approach is superior to the commonly used soilplant analysis development meter based prediction
autism spectrum disorders asds are known to be characterized by restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests and by impairments in social communication and interactions mainly including theory of mind tom processes the cerebellum has emerged as one of the brain regions affected by asds as the cerebellum is known to influence cerebral cortex activity via cerebellothalamocortical ctc circuits it has been proposed that cerebellocortical disconnection could in part underlie autistic symptoms we used restingstate rs functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri to investigate the potential rs connectivity changes between the cerebellar dentate nucleus dn and the ctc circuit targets that may contribute to asd pathophysiology when comparing asd patients to controls we found decreased connectivity between the left dn and cerebral regions known to be components of the tom network and the default mode network implicated in specific aspects of mentalizing social cognition processing and higher order emotional processes further a pattern of overconnectivity was also detected between the left dn and the supramodal cerebellar lobules associated with the default mode network the presented rsfmri data provide evidence that functional connectivity fc between the dentate nucleus and the cerebral cortex is altered in asd patients this suggests that the dysfunction reported within the cerebral cortical network typically related to social features of asds may be at least partially related to an impaired interaction between cerebellum and key cortical social brain regions
background: current obesity theories suggest that the repeated intake of highly palatable highsugar foods causes adaptions in the striatum parietal lobe and prefrontal and visual cortices in the brain that may serve to perpetuate consumption in a feedforward manner however the data for humans are crosssectional and observational leaving little ability to determine the temporal precedence of repeated consumption on brain response objective: we tested the impact of regular sugarsweetened beverage intake on brain and behavioral responses to beverage stimuli design: we performed an experiment with 20 healthyweight individuals who were randomly assigned to consume 1 of 2 sugarsweetened beverages daily for 21 d underwent 2 functional mri sessions and completed behavioral and explicit hedonic assessments results: consistent with preclinical experiments daily beverage consumption resulted in decreases in dorsal striatal response during receipt of the consumed beverage r 046 and decreased ventromedial prefrontal response during logoelicited anticipation r 044 this decrease in the prefrontal response correlated with increases in behavioral disinhibition toward the logo of the consumed beverage r 054; p 002 daily beverage consumption also increased precuneus response to both juice logos compared with a tasteless control r 045 suggesting a more generalized effect toward beverage cues last the repeated consumption of 1 beverage resulted in an explicit hedonic devaluation of a similar nonconsumed beverage p < 0001 conclusions: analogous to previous reports these initial results provide convergent data for a role of regular sugarsweetened beverage intake in altering neurobehavioral responses to the regularly consumed beverage that may also extend to other beverage stimuli future research is required to provide evidence of replication in a larger sample and to establish whether the neurobehavioral adaptations observed herein are specific to highsugar and/or nonnutritivesweetened beverages or more generally related to the repeated consumption of any type of food
voltage is one of the most fundamental concepts in electrical engineering but nevertheless has been shown to be a difficult concept for many students to help address those difficulties we designed a tutorial worksheet similar to those published by the physics education group at the university of washington in this activity students were introduced to electric potential and compared and contrasted it to voltage as electric potential and kirchhoff's voltage law are closely related we assumed learning about potential would help students gain a better qualitative understanding of voltage posttest and exam data from an introductory circuits course show that after the tutorial many students still had difficulties with voltage and potential more than three quarters of the responses concerning voltage and potential were inconsistent this suggests that most students were unable to link those two concepts we therefore conclude that potential and voltage remain conceptually very different for students in their learning process as tutorial worksheets have proved to be very effective in students overcoming conceptual difficulties it is likely that there are specific difficulties with these concepts that have not yet been identified
backgroundzirconia abutments were introduced to restore esthetic regions and showed sufficient stability to support implant restorations nonetheless to date the observation periods are shorter than those of titanium abutments purposeto assess the survival of implant crowns supported by computer aided designcomputer aided manufacturing cadcam abutments after 3 years materials and methodsfiftysix patients were selected for this prospective clinical study each patient received at least 1 titanium implant for a total of 89 fixtures a twostage surgical technique and no additional soft or hard tissue graft were used the implants were randomly divided into 3 groups receiving different cadcam abutments: titanium titanium nitride and zirconia zirconia or metalceramic crowns were used as final restorations cementation was the baseline and the restorations were checked after 6 months 1 2 and 3 years assessing any mechanical complication statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the 3year success rates resultsfive failures were reported in the zirconia group; all the failed restorations showed fractures of the abutment connection four failures occurred in posterior regions and one more occurred while screwing the abutment titanium and titanium nitride abutments had significantly higher 3year success rates than zirconia abutments p<05 conclusionsatlantis titanium and titanium nitride abutments showed optimal clinical performances after 3 years conversely atlantis zirconia abutments should be avoided to restore posterior regions
this study examines aspects of prediction of suicide and death of undetermined intent we investigated all consecutive autopsied patients between 1993 and 1997 who had been in contact with the addiction centre in malmo from 1968 onwards the staff was asked shortly after autopsy but before they knew of the manner of death if they thought the patient had committed suicide the case records were blindly evaluated and toxicological autopsy findings for alcohol in blood samples investigated the specificity of prediction was 83% and significantly more often correct than the sensitivity which was only 45% for suicide and for suicide/death of undetermined intent 93% versus 39% suicidal communication was more often considered nonserious before death of undetermined intent than before suicide the former could be predicted by ideation but not by suicide attempt reported in case records unlike suicide which was predicted by both the undetermined group also showed higher levels of alcohol in the blood at autopsy we concluded that more serious clinical investigation of suicidal feelings which may be hidden and not taken seriously and treatment of alcohol use disorders with active followup appear urgent in the efforts to prevent suicide
synthetic binding proteins are constructed using nonantibody molecular scaffolds over the last two decades indepth structural and functional analyses of synthetic binding proteins have improved combinatorial library designs and selection strategies which have resulted in potent platforms that consistently generate binding proteins to diverse targets with affinity and specificity that rival those of antibodies favorable attributes of synthetic binding proteins such as small size freedom from disulfide bond formation and ease of making fusion proteins have enabled their unique applications in protein science cell biology and beyond here we review recent studies that illustrate how synthetic binding proteins are powerful probes that can directly link structure and function often leading to new mechanistic insights we propose that synthetic proteins will become powerful standard tools in diverse areas of protein science biotechnology and medicine

although cancer outcome results from the interplay between genetics and environment researchers are making a great effort for applying molecular biology in the prognostication of differentiated thyroid cancer dtc nevertheless role of molecular characterisation in the prognostic setting of dtc is still nebulous among the most common and wellcharacterised genetic alterations related to dtc including mutations of braf and ras and ret rearrangements braf v600e is the only mutation showing unequivocal association with clinical outcome unfortunately its accuracy is strongly limited by low specificity recently the introduction of nextgeneration sequencing techniques led to the identification of tert promoter and tp53 mutations in dtc these genetic abnormalities may identify a small subgroup of tumours with highly aggressive behaviour thus improving specificity of molecular prognostication although knowledge of prognostic significance of tp53 mutations is still anecdotal mutations of the tert promoter have showed clear association with clinical outcome nevertheless this genetic marker needs to be analysed according to a multigenetic model as its prognostic effect becomes negligible when present in isolation given that any genetic alteration has demonstrated taken alone enough specificity the cooccurrence of driving mutations is emerging as an independent genetic signature of aggressiveness with possible future application in clinical practice dtc prognostication may be empowered in the near future by nontissue molecular prognosticators including circulating braf v600e and mirnas although promising use of these markers needs to be refined by the technical sight and the actual prognostic value is still yet to be validated
this paper describes the development of a pedestrian microsimulation model that was developed based on the agent based modeling approach which effectively accounts for the pedestrian intelligence and heterogeneity the model focuses on producing accurate trajectories for pedestrian interactions behavior rules that control pedestrian interactions were extracted from a detailed pedestrian behavior study conducted in vancouver bc the calibration of model parameters was performed using a genetic algorithm which aimed at minimizing the error between simulated trajectories and real trajectories obtained by means of computer vision the validation of the results was conducted using two different data sets the average errors between simulated and actual trajectories for the two data sets were 35 cm and 27 cm respectively while the average speed errors were 133% and 51% results also showed that the model was capable of predicting the correct collision avoidance strategy in 95% of the validation cases investigated
we have developed a new method for the efficient numerical simulation of colloidal suspensions this method is designed and especially wellsuited for parallel code execution but it can also be applied to singlecore programs it combines the stokesian dynamics method with a variant of the widely used barneshut algorithm in order to reduce computational costs this combination and the inherent parallelization of the method make simulations of large numbers of particles within days possible the level of accuracy can be determined by the user and is limited by the truncation of the used multipole expansion compared to the original stokesian dynamics method the complexity can be reduced from 0 n2 to linear complexity for dilute suspensions of strongly clustered particles n being the number of particles in case of nonclustered particles in a dense suspension the complexity depends on the particle configuration and is between o n and o pn p max 2 where p is the number of used processes and n p max inverted right perpendicularn/pinverted left perpendicular respectively c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved

iron is an essential trace metal in human metabolism however imbalances in iron homeostasis are prevalent worldwide and have detrimental effects on human health humans do not have the ability to remove excess iron and therefore iron homeostasis is maintained by regulating the amount of iron entering the body from the diet iron is present in the human diet in number of different forms including heme from meat and a variety of nonheme iron compounds while heme is absorbed intact the bioavailability of nonheme iron varies greatly depending on dietary composition a number of dietary components are capable of interacting with iron to regulate its solubility and oxidation state interestingly there is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that some nutrients also have direct effects on the expression and function of enterocyte iron transporters in addition to dietary factors body iron status is a major determinant of iron absorption the roles of these important dietary and systemic factors in regulating iron absorption will be discussed in this review

background: work with families and families at risk within the field of music therapy have been developing for the last decade to diminish risk for unhealthy child development families with emotionally neglected children need help to improve their emotional communication and develop healthy parentchild interactions while some researchers have investigated the effect of music therapy on either the parent or the child no study has investigated the effect of music therapy on the observed interaction between the parent and child within the field of child protection objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a dyadic music therapy intervention on observed parentchild interaction mutual attunement nonverbal communication emotional parental response selfreported parenting stress and selfreported parentchild relationship in families at risk and families with emotionally neglected children ages 512 years method: this was a randomized controlled trial study conducted at a family care center in denmark eighteen parentchild dyads were randomly assigned to receive 10 weekly music therapy sessions with a credentialed music therapist n 9 or treatment as usual n 9 observational measures for parentchild interaction selfreported measures for parenting stress and parentchild relationship were completed at baseline and 4 months postbaseline assessment results: results of the study showed that dyads who received music therapy intervention significantly improved their nonverbal communication and mutual attunement similarly parents who participated in dyadic music therapy reported themselves to be significantly less stressed by the mood of the child and to significantly improve their parentchild relationship in terms of being better at talking to and understanding their children than parents who did not receive music therapy both groups significantly improved in terms of increased positive and decreased negative emotional parental response parenting stress and stress in general there were no significant between group differences in selfperceived autonomy attachment and parental competence conclusions: the dyadic music therapy intervention examined in this study improved emotional communication between parent and child and interaction after 6 to 10 sessions and can be considered as a viable treatment alternative or supplement for families at risk and families with emotionally neglected children
background: phenotyping is a critical component of plant research accurate and precise trait collection when integrated with genetic tools can greatly accelerate the rate of genetic gain in crop improvement however efficient and automatic phenotyping of traits across large populations is a challenge; which is further exacerbated by the necessity of sampling multiple environments and growing replicated trials a promising approach is to leverage current advances in imaging technology data analytics and machine learning to enable automated and fast phenotyping and subsequent decision support in this context the workflow for phenotyping image capture data storage and curation >trait extraction >machine learning/classification >models/apps for decision support has to be carefully designed and efficiently executed to minimize resource usage and maximize utility we illustrate such an end to end phenotyping workflow for the case of plant stress severity phenotyping in soybean with a specific focus on the rapid and automatic assessment of iron deficiency chlorosis idc severity on thousands of field plots we showcase this analytics framework by extracting idc features from a set of similar to 4500 unique canopies representing a diverse germplasm base that have different levels of idc and subsequently training a variety of classification models to predict plant stress severity the best classifier is then deployed as a smartphone app for rapid and real time severity rating in the field results: we investigated 10 different classification approaches with the best classifier being a hierarchical classifier with a mean perclass accuracy of similar to 96% we construct a phenotypically meaningful ' population canopy graph' connecting the automatically extracted canopy trait features with plant stress severity rating we incorporated this image capture >image processing >classification workflow into a smartphone app that enables automated realtime evaluation of idc scores using digital images of the canopy conclusion: we expect this highthroughput framework to help increase the rate of genetic gain by providing a robust extendable framework for other abiotic and biotic stresses we further envision this workflow embedded onto a high throughput phenotyping ground vehicle and unmanned aerial system that will allow realtime automated stress trait detection and quantification for plant research breeding and stress scouting applications
reinforcement learning theory powerfully characterizes how we learn to benefit ourselves in this theory prediction errorsthe difference between a predicted and actual outcome of a choicedrive learning however we do not operate in a social vacuum to behave prosocially we must learn the consequences of our actions for other people empathy the ability to vicariously experience and understand the affect of others is hypothesized to be a critical facilitator of prosocial behaviors but the link between empathy and prosocial behavior is still unclear during functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri participants chose between different stimuli that were probabilistically associated with rewards for themselves self another person prosocial or no one control using computational modeling we show that people can learn to obtain rewards for others but do so more slowly than when learning to obtain rewards for themselves fmri revealed that activity in a posterior portion of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain sgacc drives learning only when we are acting in a prosocial context and signals a prosocial prediction error conforming to classical principles of reinforcement learning theory however there is also substantial variability in the neural and behavioral efficiency of prosocial learning which is predicted by trait empathy more empathic people learn more quickly when benefitting others and their sgacc response is the most selective for prosocial learning we thus reveal a computational mechanism driving prosocial learning in humans this framework could provide insights into atypical prosocial behavior in those with disorders of social cognition
objective both the innate and the adaptive immune responses contribute to the onset of chronic inflammation in spondyloarthritis spa the association between spa and inflammatory bowel disease ibd enteropathic spaespa has been largely established and suggests a shared pathophysiology there is evidence that innate lymphoid cells ilc are involved in the pathogenesis of both spa and ibd while no evidence has been reported to date on espa we aimed to analyse for the first time the frequency and cytokine expression of ilc in peripheral blood from espa patients compared with both ibd and healthy subjects correlations between immunophenotyping and disease activity were also explored methods espa patients n20 were prospectively enrolled healthy controls hc n10 and ibd patients n10 served as control groups peripheral blood interferon ifn gamma and interleukin il 17 expressing t and nont cells as well as ilc subsets ilc1: ifn gamma +; ilc3: il17+; natural killernk were characterised by flowcytometry correlations between il17+ cells and spa disease activity were analysed results espa patients showed higher levels of rorgamma expressing non tcells with the respect to the controls il17 producing nont cells were higher than the hc and positively correlated with ifngamma expressing cells levels as well as with spa disease activity espa showed higher levels of ilc1 and ilc3 than both ibd and hc ifngamma expressing nk cells were higher in espa than hc conclusion our preliminary findings indicate that peripheral blood of espa patients is enriched for il17 expressing ilc which distinguishes the blood compartment from both ibd and hc the increased il17 production by ilc indicates a novel role for ilc in espa
pediatricians working in an emergency environment are confronted with children admitted to emergency departments for intoxication on a daily basis we carried out a retrospective cohort study of children admitted to a pediatric emergency department due to unintentional cannabis exposure over a 10year period from 2004 to 2014 twentynine children under the age of 3 were admitted with a positive cannabis urine test eightyseven percent of intoxications occurred at the family home resin was the main form of ingested cannabis 69% the mean age was 165 +/ 52 months and mean weight was 111 +/ 21 kg sixty percent of admissions occurred between 2012 and 2014 more severe presentations based on poisoning severity score occurred over the past 2 years four children experienced seizures before admission ten children 34% had a decreased level of consciousness gcs < 12 and were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit for 1224 h all of them had ingested hashish resin the majority 70% of children suffering from neurological impairment were admitted in the last year of whom three required assisted ventilation there were no cases with major outcomes and no deaths parents were not assessed regarding their cannabis consumption conclusion: this study supports the impression that accidental child poisonings with cannabis have been more serious than previously thought for 2 years this observation may be explained by 1 the increased thc concentration in cannabis and 2 the widespread use in young adults even after they become parents introducing an addiction team inside the ped could help to improve the care links with these parents

research on rainwater harvesting mainly focuses on a building scale scant information is available about its performance on a large scale this study aims to determine the potential for and economic viability of meeting nonpotable water demand by rainwater harvesting for a large scale case 215 km 2 : amsterdam airport schiphol a dynamic model was developed to analyse scenarios of varying rainfall catchment surfaces and storage capacity four potential system configurations of catchments and nonpotable uses were analysed for their economic performance with different water prices and storage options this study found that given sufficient storage and catchment size all nonpotable water demand of schiphol can be supplied reducing drinking water demand by up to 58% diminishing returns for adding storage and catchment to the system make full supply inefficient current water charges make most large scale system configurations not viable due to high investment costs for supply networks and storage infrastructure
ankylosing spondylitis as is a complex and chronic inflammatory disease with a high heritage previous study has shown that il1a and il1b involved in inflammatory reaction but little is known about single nucleotide polymorphisms snps of il1a and il1b associated with as we conducted a casecontrol study among 267 as cases and 297 healthy controls from china in the genetic model analysis we found the t genotype of rs3783550 was associated with decreased as risk in the dominant model p 0044 and logadditive model p 0023 ; the c genotype of rs3783546 was significantly associated with decreased as risk based in the dominant model p 0044 and logadditive model p 0023 additionally the minor allele a of rs2853550 may also reduce the risk of as in dominant p 0025 and logadditive model p 0024 our results suggested that the polymorphisms of il1a and il1b are associated with the as susceptibility in the chinese han population further studies are needed to characterize the functional sequences that cause as
scholars have been increasingly interested in how everyday interactions in various places with people from different ethnic/religious background impact intergroup relations drawing on representative surveys in leeds and warsaw 2012 we examine whether encounters with ethnic and religious minorities in different type of space are associated with more tolerance towards them we find that in leeds more favourable affective attitudes are associated with contact in institutional spaces workplace and study places and socialisation spaces social clubs voluntary groups religious meeting places ; however in case of behavioural intentions operationalised as willingness to be friendly to minority neighbours only encounters in socialisation spaces play a significant role in prejudice reduction in warsaw people who have contacts with ethnic and religious minorities in public streets park public services and transport and consumption spaces cafes pubs restaurants express more positive affective attitudes towards them but only encounters in consumption space translate into willingness to be friendly to minority neighbours c 2016 the authors published by elsevier inc
background: the role of environmental exposures in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis as remains unclear in particular two types of exposures have been suspected to play a role: mechanical stress and infections the objective of this casecontrol study was to determine if childhood infections are associated with later development of as methods: the cases with as were identified through the swedish national outpatient specialisedcare register based on having been given at least one as diagnosis in the register between 2001 and 2010 five controls per case were identified in the swedish population register matched at the timepoint of the index case's first spondyloarthritis diagnosis on sex birth year and county all cases/controls matched prior to the age of 17 years were excluded as well as all cases/controls given a diagnosis of reactive arthritis or juvenile arthritis at any time point or any other diagnosis of a rheumatic disease psoriasis iridocyclitis or inflammatory bowel disease before the timepoint of matching all events of hospitalisation with an infection before the age of 17 years were retrieved from the register and categorised according to the focus of the infection odds ratios ors and confidence intervals cis were determined through conditional logistic regression analyses results: of the 2453 cases with as and 10 257 controls 174 % of the cases and 163 % of the controls had been hospitalised with an infection before the age of 17 years or 108 95 % ci 096122 appendicitis 15 % cases; 25 % controls; or 059 95 % ci 041083 respiratory tract infections cases 112 %; controls 92 %; or 124 95 % ci 107144 and in particular tonsillitis cases 37 %; controls 28 %; or 131 95 % ci 103167 were associated with as there were no associations between as and any other type of infection and the point estimates were similar in several sensitivity analyses conclusions: childhood appendicitis was associated with a decreased risk whereas respiratory tract infections were associated with an increased risk for later development of as these findings support a possible relationship between childhood infections and later development of as although the study is limited to infections resulting in inpatient care
remote sensingbased retrieval of the concentrations of water components relies largely on the accuracy of the atmospheric correction although a variety of atmospheric correction algorithms have been developed for turbid waters the waterleaving reflectance is still underestimated in extremely turbid waters such as in the changjiang yangtze estuary and the adjacent coast to address this issue this paper proposes an improved algorithm that is based on a spectral optimization algorithm esoa with a coupled wateratmosphere model the model combines an aerosol model that is constructed from aerosol robotic network aeronet observation data and a simple semiempirical radiative transfer sert model shen et al 2010 for water component retrieval four unknown parameters are involved in the coupled model: the relative humidity rh finemode fraction fmf aerosol optical thickness in the nearinfrared nir wavelength tau a lambda 0 and suspended particulate matter spm concentration cspm these parameters are estimated by a global optimization approach that is based on a genetic algorithm ga without any initial inputs validation results of the atmospherically corrected remote sensing reflectance rrs lambda from matchups between geostationary ocean color imager goci data and in situ data show that the algorithm has satisfactory accuracy the root mean square error rmse and the absolute percentage difference apd are 00089 and 3512 respectively by contrast the rrs lambda values retrieved from the same matchups using the goci data processing system gdps have higher rmse and apd of 00104 and 6915 respectively the esoa method can be implemented conveniently within the open source code of seadas v71 as an alternative and operational tool for atmospheric correction of ocean color data including goci meris and modis over highly turbid estuarine and coastal regions such as the yangtze estuary the hangzhou bay and most of the coastal ocean in eastern china c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved
adenoviruses cause a variety of diseases that range from mild to fatal in vulnerable patients its evolution occurs as a process of selection pressure; for example genetic recombination generates intermediate strains that can be more infectious or pathogenic than parental strains this study sought to determine the diversity of circulating adenoviruses in paraguayan children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with acute lower respiratory infection by using molecular biology and bioinformatics tools though amplification of penton hexon and fiber genes in 26 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates it was demonstrated the circulation of three species: b 4/26 c 21/26 and d 1/26 as well as recombination events corresponding to the hadvd isolate with at least three different genotypes d49 d9 y d15 the hadvd are associated with gastrointestinal or ocular diseases and less commonly with respiratory infections recently however it has been reported changes in behavior of these viruses due to recombination allowing them to expand their host cell repertoire these data extend the knowledge about the genetic diversity of hadv in paraguay and strongly support the importance of genomic analysis using bioinformatics tools in epidemiological surveillance of emerging recombinant strains of hadv
since earlier days most of the failures encountered by the structures or machines are mainly due to material fatigue the dynamic behaviour of the beam may change when cracks begin to appear in it knowledge of these changes in the dynamic individualism is important in crack detection as well as in structure or in machine design this paper deals with systematic study on the free vibration of eulerbernoulli beam containing open edge transverse cracks in this study two springs steel materials en 8 and en 47 are considered the effect of the top side cracks and bottom side cracks on the natural frequency of a cantilever beam is discussed the natural frequency of a cracked case cantilever beam is investigated numerically using fe analysis software ansys experimental work is done by using dewefrf to investigate the natural frequency of cracked beams for strong validation of the numerical results the results of this study suggest that the average value of natural frequencies for all top side cracked beams are identical to the average value of natural frequency for all bottom side cracked beams this is true for both en 47 and en 8 hence it is clear that the dynamic characteristic natural frequency is not changing when same configuration of cracks is either on top or bottom side of the beam the natural frequencies for en 8 material are comparatively on higher side than en 47 material for the same crack configurations in most of the cracked cases the damping effect of en 47 is greater than en 8 it is also found that as crack location increases at constant crack depth then natural frequency increases at the last location as crack depth increases natural frequencies almost remain same it is observed that the presence of top side crack and bottom side crack of the same configuration in the cantilever beam is not a function of natural frequency when cantilever beam is of a square cross section
background the mechanisms involved in the amplification of the mast cell response during anaphylaxis are unclear mouse models of anaphylaxis demonstrate the critical involvement of neutrophils these innate immune cells are highly abundant in peripheral blood and can be rapidly activated to trigger both local and systemic inflammation objective to investigate neutrophil activation in peripheral blood during acute human anaphylaxis methods patients presenting to the emergency department with anaphylaxis underwent blood sampling upon enrolment and at up to three subsequent timepoints traditional anaphylaxis biomarkers histamine and mast cell tryptase were measured by elisa and immunocap respectively plasma myeloperoxidase concentrations were measured by elisa serum soluble cd62l concentrations by cytometric bead array and both compared to healthy controls results in 72 patients 37 51% had severe anaphylaxis 33 60% were histamine positive and 47 70% were mast cell tryptase positive at enrolment myeloperoxidase concentrations were 29 95% ci: 13 65 and 50 95% ci: 24 105 fold higher in moderate and severe patients respectively compared with healthy controls and remained stable over the first 5 h following symptom onset at enrolment soluble cd62l was 29% 95% ci: 19 38 and 31% 95% ci: 22 40 lower in moderate and severe patients respectively than healthy controls and was stable over the first 5 h there were no associations between myeloperoxidase or soluble cd62l concentrations and either histamine or mast cell tryptase concentrations conclusions and clinical relevance these results provide compelling evidence for the involvement of neutrophils during acute human anaphylaxis suggesting they are activated early in the reaction regardless of mast cell activation this important finding increases our understanding of the basic mechanisms of anaphylaxis a necessary precursor to improving treatment and prevention
background and objective: antibacterial peptides abps are essential components of host defense against microbial infections present in all domains of life the amps incorporating unnatural amino acids uabps exhibit several advantages over naturally occurring amps based on factors such as bioavailability metabolic stability and overall toxicity methods: computeraided modeling and in vitro susceptibility test were combined to rationally design short uabps with potent antimicrobial activity in the procedure peptide characterization and machine learning modeling were used to develop statistical regression predictors which were then employed to guide the molecular design and structural optimization of uabps to which a number of commercially available unnatural amino acids were introduced results: an improved uabp population was obtained from which several promising candidates were successfully prepared and their antibacterial potencies against three bacterial strains staphylococcus aureus pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli were measured using broth microdilution assay consequently four uabps with hybrid structure property were determined to have high potency against the tested strains with minimum inhibitory concentration mic of <50 mu g/ml conclusions: molecular dynamics md simulations revealed that the designed uabps are amphipathic helix in solution but they would largely unfold when spontaneously embedding into an artificial lipid bilayer that mimics microbial membrane c 2016 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved

recent research and theorizing suggest that desires for groupbased dominance underpin biases towards both human outgroups and nonhuman animals a systematic study of the common ideological roots of humanhuman and humananimal biases is however lacking three studies in belgium uk and usa tested the social dominance humananimal relations model sdharm proposing that social dominance orientation sdo is a key factor responsible for the significant positive association between ethnic outgroup attitudes and speciesist attitudes towards animals even after accounting for other ideological variables that possibly confound previous findings confirming our hypotheses the results consistently demonstrated that sdo more than rightwing authoritarianism rwa is a key factor connecting ethnic prejudice and speciesist attitudes furthermore studies 2 and 3 showed that both sdo and rwa are significantly related to perceived threat posed by vegetarianism ie ideologies and diets minimizing harm to animals but with sdo playing a focal role in explaining the positive association between threat perceptions and ethnic prejudice study 3 replicated this pattern additionally including political conservatism in the model itself a significant correlate of speciesism finally a metaanalytic integration across studies provided robust support for sdharm and offers important insights into the psychological parallels between human intergroup and humananimal relations copyright c 2016 european association of personality psychology

this work proposes a novel physicsbased model for the fluid mechanics and heat transfer associated with slug flow boiling in horizontal circular microchannels to update the widely used threezone model of thome et al 2004 the heat transfer model has a convective boiling nature and predicts the time dependent variation of the local heat transfer coefficient during the cyclic passage of a liquid slug an evaporating elongated bubble and a vapor plug the capillary flow theory extended to incorporate evaporation effects is applied to estimate the bubble velocity along the channel a liquid film thickness prediction method also considering bubble proximity effects which may limit the radial extension of the film is included the minimum liquid film thickness at dryout is set to the channel wall roughness theoretical heat transfer models accounting for the thermal inertia of the liquid film and for the recirculating flow within the liquid slug are utilized the heat transfer model is compared to experimental data taken from three independent studies the 833 slug flow boiling data points cover the fluids r134a r245fa and r236fa and channel diameters below 1 mm the proposed evaporation model predicts more than 80% of the database to within +/ 30% it demonstrates a stronger contribution to heat transfer by the liquid slugs and correspondingly less by the thin film evaporation process compared to the original threezone model this model represents a new step towards a complete physicsbased modelling of the bubble dynamics and heat transfer within microchannels under evaporating flow conditions c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
a study has been carried out in three french hospitals in order to assess and model the pharmaceutical load in hospital wastewater and its impact in wwtp this study called mediflux consisted of three successive steps: first an original prioritization procedure developed in our laboratory enabled us to select a list of relevant molecules from different anatomical therapeutic chemical atc classes containing pharmaceuticals for specific hospital use such as anesthetics or antineoplastic agents and pharmaceuticals dispensed in the community then analytical quantification procedures were developed and validated according to 2002/657/ec european directive sampling campaigns were performed in three different hospitals two located in the paris area and one in a mediumsized city 150 km from paris sampling was also carried out in wastewater treatment plants at the same time in order to model the pharmaceutical loads from hospitals predicted concentrations were calculated as a first approach assuming it would be a singlebox model ie hospitals have no effect on drug loads and only human metabolism is taken into account to evaluate the fraction of drugs eliminated in hospital effluent in the last step the comparison of measured and calculated concentrations showed a satisfactory correlation for some pharmaceuticals mainly those with short elimination halflifes and weak human metabolism for others it appeared that modeling should take into account various factors such as out patient use pharmacokinetic data and molecule stability in wastewater
micrornas are small noncoding rnas that regulate gene expression by repressing translation of target cellular transcripts increasing evidences indicate that mirnas have different expression profiles and play crucial roles in numerous cellular processes delivery and expression of transgenes for cancer therapy must be specific for tumors to avoid killing of healthy tissues many investigators have shown that transgene expression can be suppressed in normal cells using vectors that are responsive to microrna regulation to overcome this problem mir145 that exhibits downregulation in many types of cancer cells was chosen for posttranscriptional regulatory systems mediated by micrornas in this study a psicheck145t vector carrying four tandem copies of target sequences of mir145 into 3'utr of the renilla luciferase gene was constructed renilla luciferase activity from the psicheck145t vector was 57% lower in mcf10a cells with high mir145 expression as compared to a control condition additionally overexpression of mir145 in mcf7 cells with low expression level of mir145 showed more than 76% reduction in the renilla luciferase activity from the psicheck145t vector inclusion of mir145 target sequences into the 3'utr of the renilla luciferase gene is a feasible strategy for restricting transgene expression in a breast cancer cell line while sparing a breast normal cell line c 2015 international union of biochemistry and molecular biology inc

the design of flow machines is still a difficult task mainly due to the large number of free geometrical parameters involved thus design optimization techniques can be applied to obtain optimized designs of these machines this work deals with optimization of radial flow machine rotors pumps and turbine where a novel methodology for the propeller design is proposed based on the topology optimization method which distributes fluid or solid in a design domain to extremize a defined objective function subjected to some constraints the design objective is to optimize the shape of the channel between two blades of the rotor to minimize the energy dissipation and vorticity and minimize or maximize the power in the case of a pump or turbine respectively these objective functions are combined in a multiobjective function a twodimensional finite element is derived in a rotating frame for modelling the rotor flow behaviour the modelling predicts the flow field between relative two blades of a rotor without considering the influence of the volute it is assumed that the fluid is flowing in an idealized porous medium subjected to a friction force which is proportional to the fluid velocity and the inverse local permeability a porous flow model is introduced with a continuous grey permeability design variable for each element that defines the local permeability of the medium and allows the transition between fluid and solid property the design optimization problem is solved by using the method of moving asymptotes mma numerical examples are presented to illustrate this methodology c 2014 elsevier bv all rights reserved

to date transcriptome profile analysis of maize seedlings in response to cold stress have been well documented; however changes in protein species abundance of maize seedlings in response to cold stress are still unknown herein leaves from the maize inbred line w9816 a coldresistance genotype were harvested at threeleaf stage and were used to identify the differential abundance protein species daps between chilling stress 4 degrees c and control conditions 25 degrees c itraqbased quantitative proteomic were used in this study as a result 173 daps were identified after chilling stress bioinformatic analysis showed that 159 daps were annotated in 38 gene ontology functional groups 108 daps were classified into 20 clusters of orthologous groups of protein categories 99 daps were enrichment in kegg pathways antioxidants assays validated that the itraq results were reliable based on functional analysis we concluded that the adaptive response of maize seedlings to chilling stress might be related to alleviation of photodamage caused by the overenergized state of thylakoid membrane more energy produced through glycolysis increased abundance of stressresponsive protein species and improvement in the overall ability to scavenge ros posttranscriptional regulation and posttranslational modifications also play important roles for maize to adapt to chilling stress biological significance: the major challenge for maize breeders is the complexity of the response to chilling stress although extensive researches have been focus on maize chilling stress using segregating populations epigenetics transcriptomics molecular biology however the molecular mechanism of chilling stress in maize remains to be further elucidated in the present paper a differential proteomic analysis was performed and the results revealed the adaptive response of maize seedlings to chilling stress might be related to alleviation of photodamage caused by the overenergized state of thylakoid membrane more energy produced through glycolysis increased abundance of stressresponsive protein species improvement in the overall ability to scavenge ros including detoxifying enzymes and antioxidants posttranscriptional regulation and posttranslational modifications also play important roles for maize to adapt to chilling stress this approach identified new protein species involved in posttranslational modifications signal transduction lipid metabolism inorganic ion transport and metabolism and other biological processes that were not previously known to be associated with chilling stress response c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
selfinterested moves such as manipulation and deception in interpersonal relationships with parties inside and outside the workplace constitute a serious concern for management machiavellianism is often directly blamed for such ethical failures but more generic individual differences such as those linked to the use of chameleonlike approaches to match an immediate cultural or social environment ie external locus of control relativistic beliefs may have indirect influences because these chameleoninducing personalities may foster selfinterested decisions by prompting the abandonment of strict moral codes this study investigates machiavellianism as a potential mechanism by which these personalities relate negatively to ethical work intentions the results obtained with a sample of 436 banking employees from spain reveal that external locus of control and relativistic beliefs relate positively to machiavellianism and that machiavellianism mediates the negative influence of chameleoninducing personalities on ethical work intentions the study thus provides novel information for managers interested in reducing employees' machiavellian tendencies and offers appropriate strategies for deterring their unethical work behaviors c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

in 1915 the california commission of immigration and housing ccih unveiled a bold new experiment: the home teacher program in los angeles this program sent volunteers into mexican communities to teach immigrant women new more american ways of homemaking and childrearing the lesson plans sample dialogues teacher testimonies and photographs featured in ccih publications provide a fascinating window on to the tense interactions between home teachers and immigrant women scholars have long explored different ways of mining institutional records and other forms of writing by americanization advocates for insights into the experiences of those who participated in the programs this essay contributes to the discussion of california's americanization curricula in two ways: first i provide a close reading of ccih texts in order to uncover and analyze three layers of recorded experience: 1 teacher biases confronted by immigrant women; 2 immigrant women's difficult material realities; and 3 immigrant women's complex responses to americanization second i provide further evidence for the view that mexican immigrant women responded to americanization efforts in a variety of ways from outright resistance to milder forms of pushback and at times conditional acceptance of the american customs presented to them in light of the evidence i argue that mexican immigrant women were doing the impossible by laying claim to a piece of california through the complex relationship they negotiated with the home teachers although americanization programs intended to flatten mexican women's ethnic affiliations the immigrant women found subtle ways to assert their agency survive hardship and prejudice and forge a new mexican american ethnic community in the process
for humans fish consumption is the major source of mercury hg exposure the aim of this study was to assess the effect of hg in the peacock blenny salaria pavo a species of the family of blennies that was used as indicator of water pollution we performed a sublethal contamination of fish to 66 mu g hgcl2 l1 during 1 4 10 and 15 days but hg concentration measured in the experimental water was much lower than the nominal concentration hg was also measured in both gill and liver tissues and displays a significant increase of its concentration in gills after 1 day of exposure followed by a decrease throughout the experiment in the liver hg burden reaches its maximum at day 4 followed also by a decrease partiallength cdna of mt1 mt2 gpx cat mnsod and cuznsod was characterized results from mrna expression levels displayed an upregulation of mt1 gpx and mnsod while a downregulation of cat was observed several biomarker activities were determined in gills and liver and exposure to hg affected all antioxidant enzymes in gills erod gst and gpx significantly decreased while cat levels increased from 4 days of hg exposure no lipid peroxidation lpo induction was observed in gills of exposed fish regarding the liver the activity of all enzymes increased significantly from the beginning of the experiment lpo induction was however induced after 4 days only the histological analysis also performed indicated that fish exhibited several damages in gills and liver mainly in relation to circulatory disturbances in the gills and regressive changes in the liver all biomarkers assessed showed that peacock blennies are able to detoxify hg from gill and liver tissues by developing various defense mechanisms

experimental and field evidence indicate a positive link between social preferences and age most strikingly between the elderly and young adults however it is possible that the seemingly positive link between age and preferences stems from confounds in experimental procedure in a dictator game study we find that elderly participants do indeed transfer higher shares of their endowments to their peers than a standard sample of student participants this result holds good even in treatments accounting for wealth differences and experimenter demand effects however we observe no difference in behavior when we compare elderly participants and students who have not previously participated in economic experiments accordingly it is possible that the seemingly stronger social preferences of the elderly are due to confounds associated with lack of experience with economic experiments in addition when comparing incentivized and hypothetical transfer decisions we observe a hypothetical bias in treatments with a take framing but not in treatments with the standard give framing c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
solar energy has an enormous potential to solve society energy needs in a sustainable way notably photovoltaic systems pv permit to obtain electricity based on solar energy however some issues must be addressed to establish pv as a reliable source of electrical power for example its low energy density one of the approaches to improve the performance of pv systems is to utilize the solar spectrum in solar cells efficiently downconversion dc is a process where a high energy photon is converted into two or more photons with lower energy trough downconversion is possible to use a wider portion of the solar spectrum raising the efficiency in different kinds of solar cells the present paper reviews the state of the art of materials and methods used to take advantage of downconversion processes in solar cells here we discuss some of the pros and cons of different designs in solar cells as well as the main characteristics of the materials utilized
although potent androgen receptor pathway inhibitors arpi improve overall survival of metastatic prostate cancer patients treatmentinduced neuroendocrine prostate cancer tnepc as a consequence of the selection pressures of arpi is becoming a more common clinical issue improved understanding of the molecular biology of tnepc is essential for the development of new effective management approaches for tnepc in this study we identify a splice variant of the myst/esa1associated factor 6 meaf6 gene meaf61 that is highly expressed in both tnepc tumor biopsies and neuroendocrine cell lines of prostate and lung cancers we show that meaf61 splicing is stimulated by neuronal rna splicing factor srrm4 rather than inducing neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of cells in prostate adenocarcinoma meaf61 upregulation stimulates cell proliferation anchorageindependent cell growth invasion and xenograft tumor growth gene microarray identifies that these meaf61 actions are in part mediated by the id1 and id3 genes these findings suggest that the meaf61 variant does not induce neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells but rather facilitates tnepc progression by increasing the proliferation rate of cells that have acquired neuroendocrine phenotypes

both genetic factors and early life adversity play major roles in the etiology of schizophrenia our previous studies indicated that social isolation si during early postnatal development leads to several lasting abnormal behavioral and pathophysiological features resembling the core symptoms of some human neuropsychiatric disorders in mice the glutamate and dopamine hypotheses are tightly linked to the development of schizophrenia the crosstalk between glutamate nmethyldaspartate acid receptors and dopamine receptors is associated with histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 hint1 which is correlated with diverse psychiatric disorders we examined the effects of si on schizophrenialike behavior and used enzymelinked immunosorbent assays to investigate the expression levels of hint1 the nr1 subunit of nmethyldaspartate acid receptor and dopamine type 2 receptor d2r in c57 mice we found that si leads to a series of schizophreniarelated deficits such as social withdrawal anxiety disorder cognitive impairments and sensorimotor gating disturbances these abnormal phenotypes paralleled changes of hint1 nr1 and d2r si may be considered a robust model of the effects of early life stress on the schizophreniarelated behaviors in mice potential interactions among hint1 nr1 and d2r may underlie the behavioral deficits induced by si copyright c 2017 the author s published by wolters kluwer health inc
prior research finds that sexually permissive individuals are judged more negatively than nonpermissive peers placing them at risk of social isolation based on the positive assortment principle ie preferences for similarity in attributes in close relationships we examined whether participants' own permissiveness mitigated negative judgments of permissive others in the samesex friendship context college students n751 evaluated a hypothetical samesex target with either 2 nonpermissive or 20 permissive past sex partners on 10 friendshiprelevant outcomes participant permissiveness attenuated some negative evaluations however preferences were rarely reversed and no moderation was found in five outcomes suggesting the role of permissivenessbased positive assortment is limited and evolutionary concerns may take precedence partial support for the sexual double standard was also found

germany appears set to miss its co2 reduction target in 2020 as a result ideas for additional political measures have been put forward one such idea involves an early phaseout of coalfired power plants however the possible impacts of such a phaseout on the energy system have not yet been fully analyzed we therefore apply a german energy system model to analyze these impacts to do so we calculate three different scenarios the first represents a businessasusual scenario while the second takes a coal phaseout into account the third scenario has to achieve the same co2 reduction as the second without being forced to implement a coal phaseout our three scenarios show that a definitive coal phaseout by 2040 would result in only a relatively small amount of additional co2 however an equal co2 reduction can be obtained using a different strategy and slightly lower costs in the latter scenario the additional costs are also distributed more evenly across the sectors the sensitivities analyzed show the robustness of the conclusions drawn in summary this analysis outlines what consequences could arise by excluding several options in parallel from a technology portfolio c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
background: nonverbal communication deficits are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder asd and have been reported in some laterborn siblings of children with asd heightenedrisk hr children however little work has investigated gesture as a function of language ability which varies greatly in this population aims: this longitudinal study characterizes gesture in hr children and examines differences related to diagnostic outcome asd language delay no diagnosis and age methods & procedures: we coded communicative gesture use for 29 hr children at ages 2 and 3 years during interactions with a caregiver at home outcomes & results: children in the asd group produced fewer gestures than their hr peers at 2 years though large individual differences were observed within each subgroup at both ages in addition reliance on particular types of gestures varied with age and outcome both asd and language delay children exhibited a pattern of reduced pointing relative to their no diagnosis peers conclusions & implications: similarities and differences exist between communication in hr infants with language delay and their hr peers reinforcing our understanding of links between verbal and nonverbal communication in populations at risk for language delay

from the moment of birth each human being builds a microbehost symbiosis which is key for the preservation of its health and wellbeing this personal symbiotic coexistence is the result of progressive enrichments in microorganism diversity through external supplies this diversity is nowadays massively overthrown by drastic changes related to clinical practice in birth management environmental exposure nutrition and healthcare behaviors the last two generations have been the frame of massive modifications in life and food habits with people being more and more sedentary overfed and permeated with drugs and pollutants we are now able to measure the impact of these changes on the gut microbiota diversity concomitantly these modifications of lifestyle were associated with a dramatic increase in incidence of immunemediated diseases including metabolic allergic and inflammatory diseases and most likely neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders microbiota is becoming a hot topic in the scientific community and in the mainstream media the number of scientific publications increased by up to a factor three over the last five years with gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases being the most productive areas in the intellectual property landscape the patent families on microbiota have more than doubled in the meantime in parallel funding either from national institutes eg from nih which funds research mainly in the field of allergies infections cancer and cardiovascular diseases from the white house which launched the national microbiome initiative or by pharmaceutical companies follow the same trend showing a boost and a strong support in the research field on microbiota all major health players are investing in microbiome research as shown by the number of deals signed and by funding during 2015 the glens round table addressed how the medicine of tomorrow considering human beings as a humanmicrobe symbiotic supraorganism could leverage microbiome knowledge and tools the rationale for our working group has been structured around four domains of innovation that could derive from ongoing efforts in deciphering the interactions between human cells and intestinal microbiome as a central component of human health namely: 1 development of stratification and monitoring tools; 2 identification of new target and drug discovery as a part of our supragenome; 4 exploitation of microbiota as a therapeutic target that can be modulated; 4 and finally as a source of live biotherapeutics and adjuvants these four streams will exemplify how microbiota has changed the way we consider a wide range of chronic and incurable diseases and the consequences of longlasting dysbiosis indepth micro biota analysis is opening one of the broadest fields of investigation for improving human and animal health and will be a source of major therapeutic innovations for tackling today's medical unmet needs we thus propose a range of recommendations for basic researchers care givers as welt as for health authorities to gain reliability in microbiome analysis and accelerate discovery processes and their translation into applications for the benefits of the people finally les ateliers de glens round table on microbiota benefited from the richness of the french ecosystem france represents a center of excellence in the microbiota research field with french institutions as institut national de la recherche agronomique inra metagenopolis micalis centre national de ta recherche scientifique cnrs unite de recherche sur les maladies infectieuses et tropicales emergentes urmite institut of cardiometabolism and nutrition ican institut des maladies metaboliques et cardiovasculaires i2mc institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicate inserm pasteur institute and gustaveroussy being topplayers for the number of publications c 2016 published by elsevier masson sas on behalf of societe francaise de pharmacologie et de therapeutique
this paper investigates the relationship between perceived ethnic age and income diversity and neighbourhood attachment accounting for measures of objective diversity calculated for small individualised neighbourhoods with data from warsaw in poland we examine whether neighbourhood ties with people of different ethnicity age and income moderate the relationship between perceived diversity and attachment we also test affective appraisals of the environment excitement and irritation as a mediator between perceived diversity and attachment perceived ethnic diversity was positively related to neighbourhood attachment and this link was mediated by the emotion of excitement perceived income diversity undermined attachment regardless of the neighbourhood ties and this link was not mediated by affective appraisals perceived age diversity was related to lower neighbourhood attachment only for individuals who had few ties with neighbours of different ages we argue that the effects of diversity may depend on the sociocultural context specifically on the level and meaning of diversity in a given society
this study explored stereotype constructions people may impute on to others in the context of a contagious disease epidemic participants were 30 undergraduate students from a large university in johannesburg south africa they completed the openended buildacharacter questionnaire which described the typical person in south africa who they currently believed to be at particular risk of hiv infection the data were thematically analysed and interpreted seven themes resulted based on the stereotyping of marginalised groups in south africa considered as being at higher risk for hiv due to historical disadvantage: blacks women and the poor a social cognitive framework explains these stereotypes as they apply to perceived outgroups and they carry risk to undermine public health interventions regarding the hiv pandemic in south africa across population segments
this paper introduces a high power density stepup converter for led applications based on a hybrid serialoutput hso architecture 1 which is suitable for onchip implementation in this system the output voltage is formed by stacking the output of a switchedcapacitor sc converter on top of a boost converter output the high power density sc converter processes around a half of the power of the system and is left unregulated the boost converter processes the remainder of the power and regulates the output voltage in comparison with conventional boostbased solutions the introduced boostsc hso drastically reduces the passive component volume and decreases peak voltage stress of switches experimental results obtained with a 37 v to 13 v 26 w 1080 khz prototype show that the introduced scboost hso converter has about three times smaller reactive component area than a conventional boost having the same power processing efficiency

while several studies have examined the effect of renewable portfolio standard laws on renewable generation in states previous literature has not assessed the potential for spatial dependence in these policies using recent spatial panel methods this paper estimates a number of econometric models to examine the impact of rps policies when spatial autocorrelation is taken into account consistent with previous literature we find that rps laws do not have a significant impact on renewable generation within a state however we find evidence that state rps laws have a significant positive impact on the share of renewable generation in the nerc region as a whole these findings provide evidence that electricity markets are efficiently finding the lowestcost locations to serve renewable load in states with more stringent rps laws in addition our results suggest that rps laws may be more effective tools for environmental policy than for economic development
to describe the variability in rheumatology visits and referrals to other medical specialties of patients with spondyloarthritis spa and to explore factors that may influence such variability nationwide crosssectional study performed in 20092010 randomly selected records of patients with a diagnosis of spa and at least one visit to a rheumatology unit within the previous 2 years were audited the rates of rheumatology visits and of referrals to other medical specialties were estimatedtotal and between centresin the study period multilevel regression was used to analyse factors associated with variability and to adjust for clinical and patient characteristics 1168 patients' records 45 centres were reviewed mainly ankylosing spondylitis 552 % and psoriatic arthritis 222 % the patients had incurred in 5908 visits to rheumatology clinics rate 254 per 100 patientyears 4307 visits to other medical specialties 196 % were referrals from rheumatology and 775 visits to specialised nurse clinics an adjusted variability in frequenting rheumatology clinics of 157 % between centres was observed this was partially explained by the number of faculties and trainees the adjusted intercentre variability for referrals to other specialties was 123 % and it was associated with urban settings number of procedures and existence of spa dedicated clinics; the probability of a patient with spa of being referred to other specialist may increase up to 25 % depending on the treating centre frequenting rheumatology clinics and referrals to other specialists significantly varies between centres after adjustment by patient characteristics

how growth microtubule dynamics and cellcycle progression are coordinated is one of the unsolved mysteries of cell biology a maize mutant tangled1 with known defects in growth and proper division plane orientation and a recently characterized cellcycle delay identified by timelapse imaging was used to clarify the relationship between growth cell cycle and proper division plane orientation the tangled1 mutant was fully rescued by introduction of cortical division site localized tangled1yfp a cyclin1b destruction box was fused to tangled1yfp to generate a line that mostly rescued the division plane defect but still showed cellcycle delays when expressed in the tangled1 mutant although an intermediate growth phenotype between wildtype and the tangled1 mutant was expected these partially rescued plants grew as well as wildtype siblings indicating that mitotic progression delays alone do not alter overall growth these data indicate that division plane orientation together with proper cellcycle progression is critical for plant growth

guided by indirect evidence recent approaches propose a tripartite crosstalk among interoceptive signaling emotional regulation and lowlevel social cognition here we examined the neurocognitive convergence of such domains first we performed three metaanalyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to identify which areas are consistently coactivated by these three systems multilevel kernel density analysis mkda revealed major overlaps in the right anterior insular and frontotemporal regions viz the orbitofrontal and inferior frontal gyri the amygdala and mid temporal lobe/subcortical structures second we explored such domains in patients with frontoinsulotemporal damage relative to controls the patients showed behavioral impairments of interoception emotional processing and social cognition with preservation of other cognitive functions convergent results from both studies offer direct support for a model of insularfrontotemporal regions integrating interoception emotion and social cognition c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
oneclass classification belongs to the one of the novel and very promising topics in contemporary machine learning in recent years ensemble approaches have gained significant attention due to increasing robustness to unknown outliers and reducing the complexity of the learning process in our previous works we proposed a highly efficient oneclass classifier ensemble based on input data clustering and training weighted oneclass classifiers on clustered subsets however the main drawback of this approach lied in difficult and time consuming selection of a number of competence areas which indirectly affects a number of members in the ensemble in this paper we investigate ten different methodologies for an automatic determination of the optimal number of competence areas for the proposed ensemble they have roots in model selection for clustering but can be also effectively applied to the classification task in order to select the most useful technique we investigate their performance in a number of oneclass and multiclass problems numerous experimental results backedup with statistical testing allows us to propose an efficient and fully automatic method for tuning the oneclass clusteringbased ensembles
introduction: methadone and buprenorphine are maintenance replacement therapies for opioid dependence; they are also used for pain management methadone and buprenorphine to a lesser extent have seen sharp increases in mortality associated with their use they have distinct routes of metabolism mostly cytochrome p450 dependent and distinct pharmacologic activity of metabolites as such metabolism may play a role in differences in their toxicity areas covered: this article reviews peerreviewed literature obtained from pubmed searches and literature referenced within the review considers first an overview of drug use and mortality over the past decade it then provides extensive detail on the in vitro and in vivo human metabolism of methadone and buprenorphine using both human and experimental animal studies it then presents the pharmacodynamic activity of parent drug and metabolites at the muopioid receptor as pglycoprotein substrates and plasma/brain concentration ratios and activity at the herg k+ channel lessons learned from drug interaction studies in humans are then examined in an attempt to bring together the combined information expert opinion: the use and misuse of these drugs contributes to the epidemic in opioidassociated mortalities a better understanding of metabolism transportand comedicationinduced changes will contribute to their safer use
introduction: lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people still face discrimination in healthcare environments and physicians often report lack of knowledge on this population's specific healthcare needs in fact recommendations have been put forward to include lesbian gay bisexual and transgender health in medical curricula this study aimed to explore factors associated with medical students' knowledge and attitudes towards homosexuality in different years of the medical course material and methods: an anonymous onlinebased questionnaire was sent to all medical students enrolled at the faculty of medicine university of porto portugal in december 2015 the questionnaire included sociodemographic questions the multidimensional scale of attitudes toward lesbians and gay men 27 items and a homosexuality knowledge questionnaire 17 items descriptive statistics anovas chisquare tests and pearson's correlations were used in the analysis results: a total of 489 completed responses was analyzed male gender religiosity and absence of lesbian gay or bisexual friends were associated with more negative attitudes towards homosexuality attitudinal scores did not correlate with advanced years in medical course or contact with lesbian gay or bisexual patients students aiming to pursue techniqueoriented specialties presented higher scores in the ` modern heterosexism' subscale than students seeking patientoriented specialties although advanced years in medical course correlated significantly with higher knowledge scores items related with lesbian gay or bisexual health showed the lowest percentage of correct answers conclusion: there seems to be a lack of exploration of medical students' personal attitudes towards lesbians and gay men and also a lack of knowledge on lesbian gay or bisexual specific healthcare needs this study highlights the importance of inclusive undergraduate curriculum development in order to foster quality healthcare

neuroscience investigations of emotional influences on social cognition have been dominated by the somatic marker hypothesis and dualprocess theories taken together these lines of inquiry have not provided strong evidence that emotional influences on social cognition rely on neural systems which code for bodily signals of arousal nor distinguish emotional reasoning from other modes of reasoning recent findings raise the possibility that emotionally influenced social cognition relies on two stages of neural changes: once when emotion is elicited and a different set of changes at the time of social cognitive judgment these findings suggest that affect infusion models may be a fruitful framework for bridging neuroscience and psychological understanding of the role of emotion in social cognition

we develop a theoretical model of security investments in a network of interconnected agents network connections introduce the possibility of cascading failures due to an exogenous or endogenous attack depending on the profile of security investments by the agents we provide a tractable decomposition of individual payoffs into an own effect and an externality which also enables us to characterize individual investment incentives recursively by considering the network with one agent removed at a time using this decomposition we provide characterization of equilibrium and socially optimal investment levels as a function of the structure of the network highlighting the role of a new set of network centrality measures in shaping the levels of equilibrium and optimal investments when the attack location is endogenized by assuming that the attacker chooses a probability distribution over the location of the attack in order to maximize damage similar forces still operate but now because greater investment by an agent shifts the attack to other parts of the network the equilibrium may involve too much investment relative to the social optimum c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved

in the present research we investigated whether the redattraction relation that has been observed for men viewing women may also be observed with regard to women's facial redness we manipulated facial redness by slightly increasing or decreasing the redness on the faces of baseline pictures of target women and then had men judge the attractiveness of the women we also examined healthiness perceptions as a mediator of the rednessattraction relation along with several other candidate mediator variables a series of experiments showed that increased redness led to increased ratings of attractiveness and decreased redness led to decreased ratings of attractiveness perceived healthiness was documented as a mediator of the influence of female facial redness on male perceptions of attractiveness and this mediation was independent of other candidate mediator variables the findings highlight the importance of attending to facial coloration as an attractionrelevant cue and point to interesting areas for subsequent research
in manufacturing engineering especially in machining process the definition of a reference plane is the first essential step within the overall process after the reference plane is applied at the component all other features are processed with reference to this basic plane during any process the component has to be clamped in order to resist the processing forces there are several clamping systems available such as pneumatic magnetic systems or magnetorheological mr systems depending on its stiffness the component is deformed due to the clamping forces stresses are introduced this effect can be neglected for components with a high stiffness and nearly rigid body behaviour however the deformation of low stiff components under clamping forces eg sheet metals is relatively large and is in the same range as the addressed accuracy of machining process due to the introduced elastic clamping stresses the component will reconfigure after clamping this phenomenon is known as springback the focus of this work is the design of a clamping system for flexible bodies in order to reduce the springback and to enable high precision processing this clamping system consists in a set of supports which adjust to the surface of the body without introducing stresses and causing no springback after the machining process the number and the arrangement of the supports are optimized as a function of the intensity and position of the milling force and the geometrical and mechanical properties of the body as well the functional unit of the clamping system is a cylindrical bodysliding nearly frictionless within a pipe numerical simulation is used for configuration and optimization the developed clamping systems can also be used to process freeform shaped bodies
connectivity between populations influences both their dynamics and the genetic structuring of species in this study we explored connectivity patterns of a marine species with longdistance dispersal the edible common sea urchin paracentrotus lividus focusing mainly on the adriaticionian basins central mediterranean we applied a multidisciplinary approach integrating population genomics based on 1 122 single nucleotide polymorphisms snps obtained from 2brad in 275 samples with lagrangian simulations performed with a biophysical model of larval dispersal we detected genetic homogeneity among eight population samples collected in the focal adriaticionian area whereas weak but significant differentiation was found with respect to two samples from the western mediterranean france and tunisia this result was not affected by the few putative outlier loci identified in our dataset lagrangian simulations found a significant potential for larval exchange among the eight adriaticionian locations supporting the hypothesis of connectivity of plividus populations in this area a peculiar pattern emerged from the comparison of our results with those obtained from published plividus cytochrome b cytb sequences the latter revealing genetic differentiation in the same geographic area despite a smaller sample size and a lower power to detect differences the comparison with studies conducted using nuclear markers on other species with similar pelagic larval durations in the same adriaticionian locations indicates speciesspecific differences in genetic connectivity patterns and warns against generalizing singlespecies results to the entire community of rocky shore habitats

studying cell differentiation and transformation allows a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the initiation and the evolution of cancer the role of proteins which participate in these processes is dependent on their location within the cell determining the subcellular localization of proteins or the changes in localization is therefore paramount in elucidating their role using quantitative mass spectrometry we characterized the protein expression and subcellular localization of nearly 5000 proteins from seven different colorectal cancer crc cell lines as well as normal colon fibroblasts and intestinal epithelial cells this cellular characterization allowed the identification of colon cancerassociated proteins with differential expression patterns as well as deregulated protein networks and pathways indeed our results demonstrate differential expression of proteins involved in cell adhesion cytoskeleton and transcription in colon cancer cells compared to normal colonderived cells pathway analyses identified different cellular functions including endocytosis and eif2 signaling whose deregulation correlates with mutations found in the different crc phenotypes our results provide an unbiased quantitative and highthroughput approach to measure changes in protein expression and subcellular protein locations in different crc cell lines
otitis media om or middle ear inflammation is the most common paediatric disease and leads to significant morbidity although understanding of underlying disease mechanisms is hampered by complex pathophysiology it is clear that epithelial abnormalities underpin the disease there is currently a lack of a wellcharacterised in vitro model of the middle ear me epithelium that replicates the complex cellular composition of the middle ear here we report the development of a novel in vitro model of mouse middle ear epithelial cells mmecs at an airliquid interface ali that recapitulates the characteristics of the native murine me epithelium we demonstrate that mmecs undergo differentiation into the varied cell populations seen within the native middle ear proteomic analysis confirmed that the cultures secrete a multitude of innate defence proteins from their apical surface we showed that the mmecs supported the growth of the otopathogen nontypeable haemophilus influenzae nthi suggesting that the model can be successfully utilised to study hostpathogen interactions in the middle ear overall our mmec culture system can help to better understand the cell biology of the middle ear and improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of om the model also has the potential to serve as a platform for validation of treatments designed to reverse aspects of epithelial remodelling that underpin om development
introduction: regulatory t cells treg play an important role in suppressing anti immunity and their depletion has been linked to improved outcomes to better understand the role of treg in limiting the efficacy of anticancer immunity we used a diphtheria toxin dtx transgenic mouse model to specifically target and deplete treg methods: tumor bearing balb/c foxp3dtr transgenic mice were subjected to different treatment protocols with or without treg depletion and tumor growth and survival monitored results: dtx specifically depleted treg in a transient dosedependent manner treg depletion correlated with delayed tumor growth increased effector t cell teff activation and enhanced survival in a range of solid tumors tumor regression was dependent on teffs as depletion of both cd4 and cd8 t cells completely abrogated any survival benefit severe morbidity following treg depletion was only observed when consecutive doses of dtx were given during peak cd8 t cell activation demonstrating that treg can be depleted on multiple occasions but only when cd8 t cell activation has returned to base line levels finally we show that even minimal treg depletion is sufficient to significantly improve the efficacy of tumorpeptide vaccination conclusions: balb/cfoxp3dtr mice are an ideal model to investigate the full therapeutic potential of treg depletion to boost antitumor immunity dtxmediated treg depletion is transient dosedependent and leads to strong antitumor immunity and complete tumor regression at high doses while enhancing the efficacy of tumorspecific vaccination at low doses together this data highlight the importance of treg manipulation as a useful strategy for enhancing current and future cancer immunotherapies
treatment of cancer patients involves a multidisciplinary approach including surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy traditionally patients with metastatic disease are treated with combination chemotherapies or targeted agents these cytotoxic agents have good response rates and achieve palliation; however complete responses are rarely seen the field of cancer immunology has made rapid advances in the past 20 years recently a number of agents and vaccines which modulate the immune system to allow it to detect and target cancer cells are being developed the benefit of these agents is twofold it enhances the ability the body's own immune system to fight cancer thus has a lower incidence of side effects compared to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy secondly a small but substantial number of patients with metastatic disease are cured by immunotherapy or achieve durable responses lasting for a number of years in this article we review the fdaapproved immunotherapy agents in the field of genitourinary malignancies we also summarize new immunotherapy agents being evaluated in clinical studies either as single agents or as a combination

fracking has become a hot topic in the media and public discourse not only because of its economic benefit but also its environmental impacts recently scientists have investigated the environmental impacts of fracking and most studies focus on its air and ground water pollution a systematic research structure and an overall evaluation of fraddng's impacts on the environment are needed because fracking does not only influence ground water but most environmental elements including but not limited to air water soil rock vegetation wildlife human and many other ecosystem components from the standpoint of the total environment this communication assesses the overall impacts of fracking on the environment and then designs a total environmental study paradigm that effectively examines the complicated relationship among the total environment fracking dramatically changes the anthroposphere which in turn significantly impacts the atmosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and biosphere through the significant input or output of water air liquid or solid waste disposals and the complex chemical components in fracking fluids the proposed total environment study paradigm of fraddng can be applied to other significant human activities that have dramatic impacts on the environment such as mountain top coal mining or oil sands for environmental studies c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
currently metals are widely used for loadbearing application due to their combination of high mechanical strength and fracture toughness however most conventional metallic materials generally remain in human body permanently bringing longterm endothelial dysfunction the corrosion products are also considered potentially harmful to tissues of the human body in recent years magnesium mg alloys had caused significant attention due to their outstanding advantages mg alloys have mechanical properties similar to bone which avoid stress shielding they are also biocompatibly essential to the human metabolism as a cofactor for many enzymes in addition the corrosion product of mg is likely to be physiologically beneficial most importantly they are perfectly biodegradable in the body fluid no material could match perfectly every requirement for a given application for mg alloys the extremely low corrosion resistance in chloride containing environments limits their applications interactions between biological environments and biomedical materials take place on the material surface and the biological response from living tissues to these extrinsic biomaterials depends on the surface properties therefore surface modification to form a hard biocompatible and corrosion resistant modified layer has recently become an interesting topic in biomaterials this paper reviews the current research and development status of plasma surface modification technologies of mg alloy for biomedical materials the unique advantage of plasma modification is that the surface properties and biocompatibility can be enhanced selectively while excellent bulk properties remain unchanged this paper discusses the characteristic of different methods finally the scientific challenges are proposed based on our researches and the works done by other groups c 2010 elsevier bv all rights reserved
past research demonstrated that racial prejudice played a significant role in the 2008 presidential election but relatively less is known about the relationship between prejudice and public opinion throughout the obama administration in the present research we examined not only whether racial attitudes were associated with evaluations of mr obama and his administration but also whether they may have influenced the development of more general political attitudes during the early years of the obama administration we investigated this question using panel data from a nationally representative sample of americans interviewed between september 2008 and july 2010 racial attitudes measured prior to the election predicted early disapproval of president obama's handling of important issues early disapproval of president obama's performance in turn predicted later perceptions of whether the state of the nation was improving further the divergence between highprejudice and lowprejudice individuals in their perceptions of the state of the nation became greater over time consistent with the idea that racial attitudes were more powerfully expressed in political judgments as time passed
background: immune mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis ra ankylosing spondylitis as and inflammatory bowel disease ibd commonly affect young and adolescent females antitumor necrosis factor tne alpha agents are increasingly used to treat these conditions but their safety during pregnancy remains unclear objectives: to evaluate the risk of pregnancy related outcomes in patients with various immune mediated diseases treated with antitnfalpha agents methods: electronic databases were searched for studies assessing the outcome of pregnancy in female patients with various immune mediated diseases who were treated with antitnfalpha agents direct and network metaanalyses were performed between antitnfalpha users nonusers and the general population results: thirteen studies including ra ibd and various immune mediated diseases were identified among the studies that compared the outcome between antitnfalpha users and the general population antitnfalpha users had a nonsignificant trend towards reduced rate of live birth odds ratio or 038 p 0081 95% confidence interval ci 013 l13 and were at significantly increased risk of preterm birth or 262 p < 00001 95% ci 212323 spontaneous abortion or 408 p 0033 95% ci 1121489 and low birth weight or 595 p 0032 95% ci 1173038 compared to the general population risk of anomalies was not elevated or 146 p 018 95% ci 084256 among the studies that compared the outcome between antitnfalpha users and nonusers there were no significant differences in the rates of live birth and pregnancy related complications among the studies that compared the outcome between nonantitnfalpha users and the general population risk of spontaneous abortion was elevated or 260 p 0033 95% ci 108627 but there were no significant differences in the rates of live birth and other pregnancy related complications network metaanalysis confirmed the rank order of all outcomes as general population nonusers and users of antitnfalpha agents ascending order based on safety conclusions: female patients with immune mediated diseases treated with antitnfalpha agents were at significantly increased risks of preterm birth spontaneous abortion and low birth weight compared to the general population but had comparable outcomes with nonusers these results provide useful information for female patients in their reproductive age and raise awareness of the conditions that they are facing among clinicians managing their care c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
this study concerns the development of a numerical methodology for initializing immersed interfacebased cfd solvers for using complex computeraided design cad geometry cfd solvers with higherorder discretization stencils require larger stencil widths which become problematic in regions of space where insufficient mesh resolution is available this problem becomes especially challenging when convoluted triangulated surface meshes generated from complex solid models are used to initialize the cutcells a pragmatic balance between desired local geometry resolution and numerical accuracy is often required to find a practical solution here a robust iterative fill algorithm is presented that balances geometry resolution with numerical accuracy via stencil size several examples are presented to illustrate the use of this initialization procedure that employs both the original cad generated triangulated surface mesh along with a level set representation of the surface to initialize cutcells and boundary proximity measures for creation of cfd stencils convergence error analysis of surface area and enclosed volumes is first presented to show the effects of fill on the geometry as a function of desired stencil size and grid resolution the algorithm is then applied to geometrically complex problems using large eddy simulation two problems are considered the first is flow around the eiffel tower the second is a combustion swirler in the context of a design problem copyright c 2016 john wiley & sons ltd

this psychophysiological study is the first to examine the relationship between emotional tears and emotional piloerection ie goosebumps although both phenomena have been related to peak states of being moved details about their temporal occurrence and the associated levels of physiological arousal have remained unknown in our study we used emotionally powerful film scenes that were selfselected by participants our findings show that even within peak moments of emotional arousal a gradation of intensity is possible the overlap of tears and goosebumps signifies a maximal climax within peak moments on the side of the stimulus we found that displays of prosocial behavior play a crucial role in the elicitation of tears and goosebumps finally based on the results of a formal film analysis of the tearseliciting clips provided by our participants as compared to randomly extracted equally long control clips from the same films we show how the technical and artistic making of the clips was optimized for the display of social interaction and emotional expressions
in applications involving digital control the set of admissible control actions is finite/quantized coupled with state constraints and fast dynamics explicit model predictive control empc provides an attractive control formalism however the design of datadriven empcs with finite admissible control sets is a challenging and relatively unexplored problem in this paper a systematic datadriven method is proposed for the design of quantized empcs qempcs for timevarying output tracking in nonlinear systems the design involves: 1 sampling the admissible state space using lowdiscrepancy sequences to provide scalability to higher dimensional nonlinear systems; 2 at each sampled data point solving for optimal quantized model predictive control actions and determining feasibility of the intrinsic mixedinteger nonlinear programming problem; and 3 constructing the qempc control surface using multiclass support vector machines mcsvms in particular four widely used mcsvm algorithms are employed to construct the proposed datadriven qempc extensive testing and comparison among the different mcsvm algorithms is performed on 2d and 5d benchmark examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methodology

this paper presents a theoretical framework intended to accommodate circuit devices described by characteristics involving more than two fundamental variables this framework is motivated by the recent appearance of a variety of socalled memdevices in circuit theory and makes it possible to model the coexistence of memory effects of different nature in a single device with a compact formalism this setting accounts for classical devices and also for circuit elements which do not admit a twovariable description fully nonlinear characteristics are allowed for all devices driving the analysis beyond the framework of chua and di ventra et al we classify these fully nonlinear circuit elements in terms of the variables involved in their constitutive relations and the notions of the differential and the stateorder of a device we extend the notion of a topologically degenerate configuration to this broader context and characterize the differentialalgebraic index of nodal models of such circuits additionally we explore certain dynamical features ofmemcircuits involving manifolds of nonisolated equilibria related bifurcation phenomena are explored for a family of nonlinear oscillators based on memdevices

in this paper we focus on tackling the problem of automatic accurate localization of detected objects in highresolution remote sensing images the two major problems for object localization in remote sensing images caused by the complex context information such images contain are achieving generalizability of the features used to describe objects and achieving accurate object locations to address these challenges we propose a new object localization framework which can be divided into three processes: region proposal classification and accurate object localization process first a region proposal method is used to generate candidate regions with the aim of detecting all objects of interest within these images then generic image features from a local image corresponding to each region proposal are extracted by a combination model of 2d reduction convolutional neural networks cnns finally to improve the location accuracy we propose an unsupervised scorebased bounding box regression usbbbr algorithm combined with a nonmaximum suppression algorithm to optimize the bounding boxes of regions that detected as objects experiments show that the dimensionreduction model performs better than the retrained and finetuned models and the detection precision of the combined cnn model is much higher than that of any single model also our proposed usbbbr algorithm can more accurately locate objects within an image compared with traditional features extraction methods such as elliptic fourier transformbased histogram of oriented gradients and local binary pattern histogram fourier our proposed localization framework shows robustness when dealing with different complex backgrounds
human prosociality has been traditionally explained in the social sciences in terms of internalized social norms recent neuroscientific studies extended this traditional view of human prosociality by providing evidence that prosocial choices in economic games require cognitive control of the impulsive pursuit of selfinterest however this view is challenged by an intuitive prosociality view emphasizing the spontaneous and heuristic basis of prosocial choices in economic games we assessed the brain structure of 411 players of an ultimatum game ug and a dictator game dg and measured the strategic reasoning ability of 386 according to the reflective normenforcement view of prosociality only those capable of strategically controlling their selfish impulses give a fair share in the ug but cognitive control capability should not affect behavior in the dg conversely we support the intuitive prosociality view by showing for the first time to our knowledge that strategic reasoning and cortical thickness of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were not related to giving in the ug but were negatively related to giving in the dg this implies that the uncontrolled choice in the dg is prosocial rather than selfish and those who have a thicker dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and are capable of strategic reasoning goaldirected use of the theory of mind control this intuitive drive for prosociality as a means to maximize reward when there are no future implications of choices

background: the transition to adulthood the gradual change in roles and responsibilities is identified as a challenging time for adolescents and young adults with physical disabilities including those with cerebral palsy health care education employment independent living and community engagement have been identified as areas of concern however relatively little research has been done to understand the experiences perceptions and needs of individuals with cerebral palsy as they transition toward adulthood objective: the objective of this study was to explore the transition experiences perceptions and needs of young adults with cerebral palsy living in one state in the southeastern united states methods: focus groups with nine young adults with cerebral palsy 1934 years were conducted the focus group interview explored the preparation for transition and experiences navigating adulthood the audiorecorded groups were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis results: young adults with cerebral palsy identified numerous challenges associated with navigating adulthood the main themes were: 1 being thrust into adulthood; 2 navigating systems and services; 3 understanding and managing my body; and 4 dealing with stereotypes and prejudice conclusions: the findings highlight the need for a holistic approach to transition with a focus on building capacity and empowerment to navigate complex systems of care navigators or facilitators are needed additionally practitioners and service providers in adult systems need further education about cerebral palsy c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
a global map of drought risk has been elaborated at the subnational administrative level the motivation for this study is the observation that little research and no concerted efforts have been made at the global level to provide a consistent and equitable drought risk management framework for multiple regions population groups and economic sectors drought risk is assessed for the period 20002014 and is based on the product of three independent determinants: hazard exposure and vulnerability drought hazard is derived from a nonparametric analysis of historical precipitation deficits at the 05; drought exposure is based on a nonparametric aggregation of gridded indicators of population and livestock densities crop cover and water stress; and drought vulnerability is computed as the arithmetic composite of high level factors of social economic and infrastructural indicators collected at both the national and subnational levels the performance evaluation of the proposed models underlines their statistical robustness and emphasizes an empirical resemblance between the geographic patterns of potential drought impacts and previous results presented in the literature our findings support the idea that drought risk is driven by an exponential growth of regional exposure while hazard and vulnerability exhibit a weaker relationship with the geographic distribution of risk values drought risk is lower for remote regions such as tundras and tropical forests and higher for populated areas and regions extensively exploited for crop production and livestock farming such as southcentral asia southeast of south america central europe and southeast of the united states as climate change projections foresee an increase of drought frequency and intensity for these regions then there is an aggravated risk for global food security and potential for civil conflict in the medium to longterm since most agricultural regions show high infrastructural vulnerability to drought then regional adaptation to climate change may begin through implementing and fostering the widespread use of irrigation and rainwater harvesting systems in this context reduction in drought risk may also benefit from diversifying regional economies on different sectors of activity and reducing the dependence of their gdp on agriculture c 2016 european commission published by elsevier ltd
absorption and metabolism of c13 9cisbetacarotene c13 9c beta c was studied in three subjects after a single oral dose subjects given 10 mg c13 betacarotene mean: 994% 9cisbetacarotene 06% alltransbetacarotene; dose a had substantial concentrations of c13 alltransbetacarotene c13 tr beta c and c13 alltrans retinol c13 retinol but very low concentrations of c13 cisbetacarotene c13 cis beta c in saponified plasma 5 h after dosing as determined by hplc and isotoperatio mass spectrometry there was no evidence of appreciable absorption of c13 9cis retinol to determine the proportion of c13 tr beta c and c13 retinol derived from c13 9c beta c a second set of studies in the same subjects was performed with the same isomeric composition except with c13 labeling only in alltransbetacarotene dose b the results indicated that >95% of plasma c13 tr beta c and c13 retinol observed after dose a was derived from c13 9c beta c the concentrations of c13 tr beta c observed in excess of that derived from the trace amounts of c13 tr beta c in the dose indicated that a significant proportion of the c13 9c beta c dose was isomerized to c13 tr beta c before entering the bloodstream although precise quantitative estimates of the extent of isomerization of 9cisbetacarotene could not be made it is apparent that cistrans isomerization of 9cisbetacarotene to alltransbetacarotene contributed to the near absence of postprandial plasma 9cisbetacarotene after its oral administration in humans the observation of different ratios of betacarotene to retinol between the two dosing protocols suggests that isomerization did not occur exclusively before uptake by the intestinal mucosa these results indicate that isomerization of ingested 9cisbetacarotene before its secretion into the bloodstream limits the potential supply of 9cis retinoids to tissues and increases the vitamin a value of 9cisbetacarotene

a 24 kda protein is one of the important components in haemonchus contortus barber pole worm excretory/secretory products hcesps which was shown to have important antigenic function however little is known about the immunomodulatory effects of this protein on host cell in the present study gene encoding 24kda excretory/secretory protein hces24 was cloned the recombinant protein of hces24 rhces24 was expressed in a histidinetagged fusion protein soluble form in escherichia coli binding activity of rhces24 to goat pbmcs was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay ifa and its immunomudulatory effect on cytokine secretion cell proliferation cell migration and nitric oxide production were observed by coincubation of rhces24 ifa results revealed that rhces24 could bind to the pbmcs the interaction of rhces24 increased the production of il4 il10 il17 and cell migration in dose dependent manner however rhces24 treatment significantly suppressed the production of ifn gamma proliferation of the pbmc and nitric oxide no production our findings showed that the rhces24 played important regulatory effects on the goat pbmcs
for many simulation models it can be prohibitively expensive or physically infeasible to obtain a complete set of experimental data to calibrate model parameters in such cases one can alternatively employ validated higherfidelity codes to generate simulated data which can be used to calibrate the lowerfidelity code in this paper we employ an informationtheoretic framework to determine the reduction in parameter uncertainty that is obtained by evaluating the highfidelity code at a specific set of design conditions these conditions are chosen sequentially based on the amount of information that they contribute to the lowfidelity model parameters the goal is to employ bayesian experimental design techniques to minimize the number of highfidelity code evaluations required to accurately calibrate the lowfidelity model we illustrate the performance of this framework using heat and diffusion examples a 1d kinetic neutron diffusion equation and a particle transport model and include initial results from the integration of the highfidelity thermalhydraulics code hydrath with a lowfidelity exponential model for the friction correlation factor c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
repeated exposure to methamphetamine meth can cause severe neurotoxicity to the cortical neurons in the present study we investigated the effect of meth on cognitive function deficits and determined the neuroprotective effects of memantine mem on memory impairment induced by meth the protein levels of bcl2 and cleaved caspase3 in prefrontal cortex pfc were further examined to exploring the underlying mechanism we found that repeated meth administration impaired long term 24 h memory retention without affecting short term 5 min memory retention coadministration of mem with meth before training session significantly improved methinduced cognitive function meth significantly decreased expression level of bcl2 and increased expression level of cleaved caspase3 in the pfc the changes can be prevented by mem pretreatment thus these results demonstrated that mem pretreatment reversed methinduced changes of protein levels of apoptoticrelated gene and produced protective effects against methinduced cognitive deficits suggesting the effectiveness of mem may be due to its antiapoptotic activity c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved
flow experience has been widely investigated in experiential activities such as sports the performing arts gaming and internet usage most studies focus on the positive aspects of flow experience and its effect on performance in stark contrast gambling research focusing on the negative side of addiction lacks an indepth investigation of gamblers' positive flow encounters this separation of research lines seems out of place given that recent research indicates connections between flow and addiction joining both constructs in a causaleffects model helps one gain a better understanding of their relationship and its contingencies this article empirically investigates whether and how it is possible to observe a janus face of flow with its various subdimensions in online gambling empirical data were collected from 500 online gamblers by applying a structured questionnaire with established scales the data were analyzed with a confirmatory factor analysis and a doublehurdle model to separate casual gamblers who are unsusceptible to any addiction issues from gamblers affected by initiatory addiction issues the findings indicate that online gambling addiction is negatively influenced by two subdimensions of flow experience namely a sense of control and concentration on the task at hand whereas it is enhanced by a transformation of time and autotelic experience
in this article the loadsettlement characteristics of unreinforced and reinforced twolayered soil during the loading process are investigated a series of bearing ratio tests was performed on a granular soil as the base layer overlaying a cohesive soil as the subgrade layer three reinforcing conditions unreinforced reinforced with nonwoven geotextile and reinforced with geogrid at the interface of layers with four compaction moisture contents cmcs of the subgrade layer and three thicknesses of the base layer for both soaked and nonsoaked conditions are considered the results show that the cmc of the subgrade layer has a significant effect on the behavior of twolayered soil such as swelling amount and the efficiency of the reinforcements reinforcing with geogrid resulted in a considerable increase in strength of the soaked samples due to adhesion between geogrids and clayey subgrade layer for nonwoven geotextiles strength of the twolayered soil decreased at shallow penetration depths due to reinforcements; and as the penetration increased in depth the strength also increased also it was found that with decreases in base layer thickness the test variable's value ie cmc and the type of geosynthetic reinforcement have significant effects on the behavior of twolayered soil

this paper describes the reinforcing effects of multiple layers of geocell in combination with rubbersoil mixture layers in sand and compares their behaviour with that of the multilayered geocell reinforcement alone using plate loading at a diameter of 300 mm the plate load tests were performed in an outdoor test pit dug in natural ground measuring 2000 x 2000 mm in plan and 700 mm in depth the geocell used in the tests was nonperforated with pocket size 110 x 110 mm 2 and height 100 mm fabricated from continuous polypropylene filaments as a nonwoven geotextile the optimum embedded depth of the first layer of geocell and the vertical spacing of geocell layers were found to be approximately 02 times the footing diameter and the optimum percentage of rubber replacement was found to be around 8% by weight of the soil mixture both bearing capacity increase and settlement reduction were highest when multiple layers of geocell and rubber reinforcement were used results show that the reinforcements' efficiency decreased as the number of reinforcement layers increased particularly at low settlement ratios higher bearing capacity and lower settlement were achieved by replacing the layers beneath the geocell layers with the rubbersoil mixture at a ratio of settlement to plate diameter of 2% the values of bearing pressure were in the ratio 1:23:3 for respectively the unreinforced installation the installation with three layers of geocell and the installation with three layers of geocell and rubbersoil between the layers the inclusion of the geocell layers reduces the vertical stress transferred down through the foundation bed by distributing the load over a wider area for example at the pressure of 550 kpa applied on the soil surface the transferred pressure at the depth of 510 mm is about 48% 34% and 27% for the reinforced bed with one two and three layers of geocell respectively compared with the stress in the unreinforced bed furthermore use of the combination of geocell and rubbersoil mixture layers is more effective than use of geocell layers only in reducing the stress transferred downwards for example 350 mm beneath a soil surface that carries a stress of 830 kpa the vertical stress is 15% less when two geocell layers are combined with two rubbersoil mixture layers than when there are only two geocell layers
ageism can generate conflict and harm wellbeing our paper integrates the aging stereotypes in interaction model with intergroup contact theory to predict how communicative elements mediate the effect of intergenerational contact on warmth and competence stereotypes of older adults as a group students n288 were randomly assigned to imagine having a conversation with an older adult in one of six experimentally manipulated contact conditions: a competent/incompetent older woman a sociable/unsociable older woman or a moral/immoral older woman participants' stereotypes of older adults were affected by the characteristics of their communication partner and this effect was mediated by specific communication behaviors imagined by the participant for two of the three trait dimensions for perceptions of competence overaccommodation was the key mediator for perceptions of sociability the key mediator was humorous communication these mediators represent an expansion in how we understand not just the outcomes of intergroup contact but also the communicative mechanisms through which it occurs
the home automation is one of the most customers of electrical energy after the industry lighting represents on average about 15% of the annual electricity bill excluding gas and hot water different studies have been made to reduce the electrical energy consumption like automatic switching and time programming but all these techniques have not an important rate in reducing the electrical energy consumption so we note that an intelligent lighting which varies with the users need remains important source of economy of the energy the intelligent lighting is obtained by using ambient intelligence ami multi agent system mas have become the important paradigm to develop an ambient system because they have important characteristics like autonomy proactivity and mobility to respond better to the main characteristic of ambient intelligence like the adaptability to the context in this area we propose an adaptive and intelligent lighting system in which each light source is represented by a software agent and the set of agents compose and coordinate their competences in order to illuminate a region with minimum energy consumption
hatred of terrorists is an obstacle to the implementation of effective counterterrorism policiesit invites indiscriminate retaliation whereas many of the greatest successes in counterterrorism have come from understanding terrorists' personal and political motivations drawing from psychological research traditional prejudice reduction strategies are generally not well suited to the task of reducing hatred of terrorists instead in 2 studies we explored education's potential ability to reduce extreme negative attitudes toward terrorists study 1 compared students in a college course on terrorism treatment with waitlisted students measuring prosocial attitudes toward a hypothetical terrorist initially all students reported extremely negative attitudes; however at the end of the semester treatment students' attitudes were significantly improved study 2 replicated the effect within a sample of treatment and control classes drawn from universities across the united states the present work was part of an ongoing research project focusing on foreign policy and the perceived threat of terrorism; thus classes did not explicitly aim to reduce prejudice making the effect of treatment somewhat surprising one possibility is that learning about terrorists crowds out the initial pejorative associationsthat is the label terrorism may ultimately call more information to mind diluting its initial negative associative links alternatively students may learn to challenge how the label terrorist is being applied in either case learning about terrorism can decrease the extreme negative reactions it evokes which is desirable if one wishes to implement effective counterterrorism policies

neurons are highly differentiated cells responsible for the conduction and transmission of information in the nervous system the proper function of a neuron relies on the compartmentalization of their intracellular domains differentiated neuroblastoma cells have been extensively used to study and understand the physiology and cell biology of neuronal cells here we show that differentiation of n1e115 neuroblastoma cells is more pronounced upon exposure of a chemical analog of cyclic amp camp dbcamp we next analysed the expression of key microtubuleregulating proteins in differentiated cells and the expression and activation of key camp players such as epac pka and akap79/150 most of the microtubulepromoting factors were up regulated during differentiation of n1e115 cells while microtubuledestabilizing proteins were down regulated we observed an increase in tubulin posttranslational modifications related to microtubule stability as expected dbcamp increased pka and epacdependent signalling consistently pharmacological modulation of epac activity instructed cell differentiation number of neurites and neurite length in n1e115 cells moreover disruption of the pkaakap interaction reduced these morphometric parameters interestingly pka and epac act synergistically to induce neuronal differentiation in n1e115 altogether these results show that the changes observed in the differentiation of n1e115 cells proceed by regulating several microtubulestabilizing factors and the acquisition of a neuronal phenotype is a process involving concerted although independent functions of epac and pka

the mechanics of intracardiac blood flow and the epigenetic influence it exerts over the heart function have been the subjects of intense research lately fetal intracardiac flows are especially useful for gaining insights into the development of congenital heart diseases but have not received due attention thus far most likely because of technical difficulties in collecting sufficient intracardiac flow data in a safe manner here we circumvent such obstacles by employing 4d stic ultrasound scans to quantify the fetal heart motion in three normal 20week fetuses subsequently performing 3d computational fluid dynamics simulations on the left ventricles based on these patientspecific heart movements analysis of the simulation results shows that there are significant differences between fetal and adult ventricular blood flows which arise because of dissimilar heart morphology e/a ratio diastolicsystolic duration ratio and heart rate the formations of ventricular vortex rings were observed for both e and awave in the flow simulations these vortices had sufficient momentum to last until the end of diastole and were responsible for generating significant wall shear stresses on the myocardial endothelium as well as helicity in systolic outflow based on findings from previous studies we hypothesized that these vortexinduced flow properties play an important role in sustaining the efficiency of diastolic filling systolic pumping and cardiovascular flow in normal fetal hearts
a storm water pond's effectiveness to treat particulate bound pollutants in urban runoff depends on its hydraulic behavior departures from the ideal plug flow such as shortcircuiting and mixing pose hindrances to pond design the goal of this study was to assess the importance of wind on storm water pond hydraulics high resolution acoustic velocity measurements were conducted in a 03ha 2m deep pond during dry weather results suggest that winds drive a turbulent threedimensional flow regime including a lateral circulation and vertical exchange flows a fully developed surface layer representing 1/3d of the water depth with drift scaling as 0004 on wind speed at 10m above ground was observed in the downwind section of the pond windinduced vertical mixing shortcircuiting and basin scale mixing were estimated to occur faster than the typical nominal residence time in storm water ponds wind is therefore an important hydraulic driver in small water systems which may potentially reduce their treatment performance local landscaping may be used as a wind mitigation measure

despite a wealth of knowledge about the neural mechanisms behind emotional facial expression processing little is known about how they relate to individual differences in social cognition abilities we studied individual differences in the eventrelated potentials erps elicited by dynamic facial expressions first we assessed the latent structure of the erps reflecting structural face processing in the n170 and the allocation of processing resources and reflexive attention to emotionally salient stimuli in the early posterior negativity epn and the late positive complex lpc then we estimated brainbehavior relationships between the erp factors and behavioral indicators of facial identity and emotionprocessing abilities structural models revealed that the participants who formed faster structural representations of neutral faces ie shorter n170 latencies performed better at face perception r 51 and memory r 42 the n170 amplitude was not related to individual differences in face cognition or emotion processing the latent epn factor correlated with emotion perception r 47 and memory r 32 and also with face perception abilities r 41 interestingly the latent factor representing the difference in epn amplitudes between the two neutral control conditions chewing and blinking movements also correlated with emotion perception r 51 highlighting the importance of tracking facial changes in the perception of emotional facial expressions the lpc factor for negative expressions correlated with the memory for emotional facial expressions the links revealed between the latency and strength of activations of brain systems and individual differences in processing socioemotional information provide new insights into the brain mechanisms involved in social communication
faces and voices in isolation prompt consistent social evaluations however most human interactions involve both seeing and talking with another person our main goal was to investigate how facial and vocal information are combined to reach an integrated person impression in study 1 we asked participants to rate faces and voices separately for perceived trustworthiness attractiveness and dominance most previous studies relied on stimuli in which extravocal information eg verbal content prosody may have confounded voicebased effects; to prevent these unwanted influences we used brief neutral vowel sounds voices like faces led to the formation of highly reliable impressions voice trustworthiness correlated with voice attractiveness mirroring the relation between face trustworthiness and attractiveness but did not correlate with voice dominance inconsistent with the possibility that face and voice evaluations are indicative of real character traits we found no positive correlations between judgments of trustworthiness or dominance based on faces and the same judgments based on voices there was also no correlation between face attractiveness and voice attractiveness in study 2 we asked participants to evaluate male targets after seeing their faces and hearing their voices faces and voices contributed equally to judgments of trustworthiness and combined to produce a significant interaction effect for attractiveness faces were given more weight than voices possibly due to the predominantly visual character of the attractiveness concept there was no interaction effect for dominance the reverse pattern was true with voices having a larger effect than faces on final judgments in this case the auditory cues may be perceived to be more reliable because of the strong links between voice pitch masculinity and dominance

this paper extends the capabilities of the 3d smith chart for representing positive and negative differentialphase group delay and the associated loaded resonator quality factor displayed simultaneously with scattering s parameters here mathematical concepts inspired from elementary differential geometry and topology are used to implement 3d projections it is shown that a condition for a circuit to exploit negative differentialphase group delay is that its sparameter winding number should be >0 relative to its origin finally exemplar network responses that exhibit both positive and negative differentialphase group delay and loaded resonator quality factor are shown with the 3d smith chart the convenience of being able to simultaneously display a wider range of parameters on one visualization platform with the 3d smith chart may help to speedup the design and analysis of microwave circuits by the user
analyses of alternating electrical circuits in electrical engineering are usually based on assumption that currents and voltages are sinusoidal values such assumption allows analysis of electrical networks by symbolic mathematical calculation it also allows the application of vector diagrams in representing relationship of the analyzed electrical values in practice periodic non sinusoidal values are sometimes found for solving such values symbolic mathematical calculation and vector diagrams cannot be used in this paper is shown how such non sinusoidal periodic values can be separated by applying fourier series into infinite series which contains a constant term and infinitely many harmonic components that way allows all the acquired knowledge and methods for solving sinusoidal periodic values to still be used

in intensive agricultural systems such as mediterranean greenhouses monitoring soil nutrient and salt status is essential for optimising vegetable production and minimising soil and water pollution this work analyses the dynamics of electrical conductivity ecss and nutrient concentration in soil solution collected simultaneously with various zerotension lysimeters and a suction cup a tension lysimeter throughout two greenhouse tomato crops the ecss obtained with zerotension lysimeters funnel and plate lysimeter was generally lower than that with the suction cup irrespective of soil depth moreover the soil solution concentration of potassium calcium magnesium sodium chloride and sulphate obtained with funnel lysimeter fullstop tm was generally lower than that with suction cup throughout both cycles while no clear differences were found for the nitrate concentration at 025 m depth in the 2013/14 cycle or at 038 m depth in the 2015 one overall it appears that the soil solutions collected with the suction cup and the funnel lysimeter represent different soil solution status and processes the funnel lysimeter collects freely draining soil solution and it may therefore provide better information about the movement of elements between soil horizons whereas the suction cup can sample soil solution from soil pores with longer residence times especially under unsaturated flow conditions and might represent better the available element concentrations for plant nutrition studies the differential response found for nitrate could be due to the fact that it is a very mobile element within the soil the soil water matric potential was slightly higher in the soil with zerotension lysimeters throughout most of the 2013/14 cycle and so these devices might alter soil solution movement and water and nutrient availability on the other hand in general a good fit was found between the soil solution concentration of nitrate potassium calcium and sodium measured with a rapid analysis system laqua tm and that measured using the reference laboratory method this rapid system in combination with the suction cup can facilitate the farmers' control of soil nutrient and salt status c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
purpose the presence of activated brown adipose tissue abat has been associated with a reduced risk of obesity in adults we aimed to investigate whether the presence of abat in patients undergoing f18fdg pet/ct examinations was related to blood lipid profiles liver function and the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld methods we retrospectively and prospectively analysed the f18fdg pet/ct scans from 5 907 consecutive patients who were referred to the nuclear medicine department of the marmara university school of medicine from outpatient oncology clinics between july 2008 and june 2014 for a variety of diagnostic reasons attenuation coefficients for the liver and spleen were determined for at least five different areas blood samples were obtained before pet/ct to assess the blood lipid profiles and liver function results a total of 25 of the 5 907 screened individuals fulfilling the inclusion criteria for the study demonstrated brown fat tissue uptake abat + subjects after adjustment for potential confounders 75 individuals without evidence of abat on pet abat subjects were enrolled for comparison purposes the abat + group had lower total cholesterol lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase levels p < 001 whereas we found no significant differences in the serum triglyceride and highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels between the two groups the prevalence of nafld was significantly lower in abat + than in abat subjects p < 001 conclusion our study showed that the presence of abat in adults had a positive effect on their blood lipid profiles and liver function and was associated with reduced prevalence of nafld thus our data suggest that activating brown adipose tissue may be a potential target for preventing and treating dyslipidaemia and nafld

the grey water footprint refers to the volume of water that is required to assimilate polluted water it reflects the intensity of water pollution caused by water use for human activities this study aims to address some major shortcomings associated with grey water footprint accounting in the literature and discuss several ways towards its improvement global maize production is used for illustration the study specifically tackles three issues: the appropriate water quality standards for grey water footprint assessment; grey water footprint for multiple pollutants; and the influence of spatial resolution of the assessment on the level of grey water stress a biophysical crop model is applied to quantify nitrogen and phosphorus losses to water in maize production on a global scale with a 05degree spatial resolution the study shows that the grey water footprint calculation is highly sensitive to the water standards applied the results also suggest that the grey water footprint relating to nitrogen and phosphorus pollution caused by maize production alone has already exceeded their local water availability in many parts of the world grey water stress shows a more critical situation at the grid level than at the watershed level for maize cultivation because the former represents the local concentration whereas the latter gives the average situation of the whole watershed this study highlights the need for standardizing the setting of water quality standards for a consistent grey water footprint assessment taking into consideration the diverse aquatic ecosystems and ambient water quality requirements across regions as well as the presence of multiple pollutants in water bodies c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
objective: childhood maltreatment is widely accepted as a risk factor for drug addiction from adolescence to adulthood however the influence of childhood maltreatment on drug treatment related variables such as drug abstinence motivation and selfconcept as well as selfefficacy remains unclear this study aims at exploring whether selfconcept mediates the relationship between childhood maltreatment and abstinence motivation as well as selfefficacy among drug addicts methods: this study involves 816 550 males 226 females mean age 3459 range 1658 years drug addicts from compulsory detoxification units participants completed questionnaires including the childhood trauma questionnaire 28 item short form ctq sf tennessee selfconcept scale tscs general selfefficacy scale gses and drug abstinence motivation questionnaire damq results: the structural equation model sem analysis including total and specific forms of maltreatment scores showed that childhood maltreatment was negatively associated with selfconcept selfefficacy and abstinence motivation selfconcept was positively associated with selfefficacy and abstinence motivation conversely significant association between selfefficacy and abstinence motivation did not exist an indirect analysis showed that selfconcept mediated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and selfefficacy critically selfconcept arbitrated the relationship between childhood maltreatment and abstinence motivation the indirect effect of selfconcept between childhood maltreatment and abstinence motivation still existed when the total scores of maltreatment were replaced by the scores of specific forms of maltreatment conclusions: these results demonstrated that selfconcept is a critical factor in understanding the relationship between childhood maltreatment and abstinence motivation as well as selfefficacy among drug addicts improving the sense of selfworth may be an effective intervention therapy among drug addicts with childhood maltreatment history c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the objective of this work is to assess the potential and limitations of current practice in computational fluid dynamic modeling in predicting vortical flowfields over a generic 53degree swept diamond wing with rounded leading edges this wing was designed under sto avt task group 183 and has a constant naca 64a006 airfoil section with a leading edge radius of 0264 percent chord cfd simulations were run for different angles of attack at a mach number of 015 and a reynolds number of 27 x 10 6 based on the mean aerodynamic chord to match experiments the wind tunnel experiments of the diamond wing were carried out in the institute of aerodynamics and fluid mechanics of the technische universitat munchen germany and include aerodynamic lift drag and pitch moment measurements as well as spanwise pressure distributions at different chordwise locations this data set is used to validate the cfd results the results presented demonstrate that the cfd compare well with the experiments at small angles of attack; the pitch moments predicted by the sarc turbulence model provide a better match to experimental results than the sa model at moderate angles of attack; and at high angles of attack cfd predictions are not as good the flow visualization results show that a leadingedge vortex is formed above the upper surface of the wing at an angle of attack of about eight degrees this vortex becomes larger and stronger when the angle of attack is increased with increasing angle of attack the vortex formation point moves upstream and the vortex core moves inboard towards the wing center finally the computational results show that the flow over the diamond wing is relatively steady throughout the range of angles of attack published by elsevier masson sas

leaf area index lai is a key parameter to characterize vegetation dynamics and ecosystem structure that determines the ecosystem functions and services such as clean water supply and carbon sequestration in a watershed however linking lai dynamics and environmental controls ie coupling biosphere atmosphere and anthroposphere remains challenging and such type of studies have rarely been done at a watershed scale due to data availability the present study examined the spatial and temporal variations of lai for five ecosystem types within a watershed with a complex topography in the upper heihe river basin a major inland river in the arid and semiarid western china we integrated remote sensingbased glass global land surface satellite lai products interpolated climate data watershed characteristics and land management records for the period of 20012012 we determined the relationships among lai topography air temperature and precipitation and grazing history by five ecosystem types using several advanced statistical methods we show that longterm mean lai distribution had an obvious vertical pattern as controlled by precipitation and temperature in a hilly watershed overall watershedwide mean lai had an increasing trend overtime for all ecosystem types during 20012012 presumably as a result of global warming and a wetting climate however the fluctuations of observed lai at a pixel scale 1 km varied greatly across the watershed we classified the vegetation changes within the watershed as 'improved' 'stabilized' and 'degraded' according their respective lai changes we found that climate was not the only driver for temporal vegetation changes for all land cover types grazing partially contributed to the decline of lai in some areas and masked the positive climate warming effects in other areas extreme weathers such as cold spells and droughts could substantially affect interannual variability of lai dynamics we concluded that temporal and spatial lai dynamics were rather complex and were affected by both climate variations and human disturbances in the study basin future monitoring studies should focus on the functional interactions among vegetation dynamics climate variations land management and human disturbances published by elsevier bv
we use remote sensing of the proton aurora with the imagefuv si12 imager for magnetopause to aurora global explorationfar ultravioletspectrographic imaging at 1218 nm instrument and radar measurements of the ionospheric convection from the superdarn super dual aurora radar network facility to estimate the open magnetic flux in the earth's magnetosphere and the reconnection rates at the dayside magnetopause and in the magnetotail during intervals of steady magnetospheric convection smc we find that smc intervals occur with relatively high open magnetic flux average similar to 0745 gwb standard deviation similar to 016 gwb which is often found to be nearly steady when the magnetic flux opening and closure rates approximately balance around 55 kv on average with a standard deviation of 21 kv we find that the residence timescale of open magnetic flux defined as the ratio between the open magnetospheric flux and the flux closure rate is roughly 4 h during smcs interestingly this number is approximately what can be deduced from the discussion of the length of the tail published by dungey 1965 assuming a solar wind speed of similar to 450 km s 1 we also infer an enhanced convection velocity in the tail driving open magnetic flux to the nightside reconnection site we compare our results with previously published studies in order to identify different magnetospheric modes these are ordered by increasing open magnetic flux and reconnection rate as quiet conditions smcs substorms with an important overlap between these last two and sawtooth intervals
in the summer of 1967 a relatively complete skeleton of a juvenile was excavated from the ishkeenickh river cave site now the ksi hlginx river in british columbia canada dating from approximately 2000 years ago this individual likely aged between 10 and 12 years at time of death displays osteological features consistent with a chronic arthropathy the most striking pathological changes are on the spine with bony ankylosis present on several of the cervical and thoracic vertebrae lesions can also be observed on the ribs the ilia the femora and a tibia the arthritic conditions of juvenileonset ankylosing spondylitis juvenile psoriatic arthritis and juvenileonset adulttype rheumatoid arthritis along with klippelfeil syndrome are possible aetiologies discussed as part of a differential diagnosis the presence of postmortem damage as well as missing bones makes an absolute diagnosis of a disease impossible however the lesions present on this skeleton seem to be most consistent with juvenileonset ankylosing spondylitis the majority of published research on these diseases appears in clinical contexts therefore this case study represents a unique opportunity to observe the bony changes that occur with juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the context of palaeopathology c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
the dynamics of a population undergoing selection is a central topic in evolutionary biology this question is particularly intriguing in the case where selective forces act in opposing directions at two population scales for example a fastreplicating virus strain outcompetes slowerreplicating strains at the withinhost scale however if the fastreplicating strain causes host morbidity and is less frequently transmitted it can be outcompeted by slowerreplicating strains at the betweenhost scale here we consider a stochastic ballandurn process which models this type of phenomenon we prove the weak convergence of this process under two natural scalings the first scaling leads to a deterministic nonlinear integropartial differential equation on the interval 0 1 with dependence on a single parameter lambda we show that the fixed points of this differential equation are beta distributions and that their stability depends on lambda and the behavior of the initial data around 1 the second scaling leads to a measurevalued flemingviot process an infinite dimensional stochastic process that is frequently associated with a population genetics
multiview facial expression recognition is a challenging and active research area in computer vision in this paper we propose a simple yet effective method called the localityconstrained linear coding based bilayer llcbl model to learn discriminative representation for multiview facial expression recognition to address the issue of large pose variations localityconstrained linear coding is adopted to construct an overall bagoffeatures model which is then used to extract overall features as well as estimate poses in the first layer in the second layer we establish one specific viewdependent model for each view respectively after the pose information of the facial image is known we use the corresponding viewdependent model in the second layer to further extract features by combining all the features in these two layers we obtain a unified representation of the image to evaluate the proposed approach we conduct extensive experiments on both bu3dfe and multipie databases experimental results show that our approach outperforms the stateoftheart methods c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved

growing evidence indicates that gratefulness and gratitude are important for wellbeing and happiness yet research to date has been hindered by a lack of conceptual clarity into the nature of these constructs the present paper reviews existing literature and argues for a distinction between gratefulness and gratitude while both gratefulness and gratitude are types of appreciative functioning and both involve benefit appraisals only the latter concerns perceived agency a set of triggers moderating factors and motivation and behavioural processes involved in gratefulness and gratitude are outlined and differences are highlighted from this vantage it is argued that appreciative functioning can be adequately represented as a complex dynamic system which involves a plurality of interacting processes some of these processes are common to gratefulness and gratitude and some are unique to each the proposed conceptualisation of appreciative functioning spans aspects of attention cognition emotion motivation and social behaviour integrating the diverse approaches to gratefulness and gratitude taken in the literature it is suggested that grateful dispositions can be understood as characteristic selfreinforcing patterns in which this complex system functions the paper also highlights the need to measure gratitude and gratefulness more independently and to both qualitatively and quantitatively determine the unique contribution of the two constructs to wellbeing
main conclusion overexpression of the citrus cstip2;1 improves plant growth and tolerance to salt and drought stresses by enhancing cell expansion h 2 o 2 detoxification and stomatal conductance tonoplast intrinsic proteins tips are a subfamily of aquaporins belonging to the major intrinsic protein family in a previous study we have shown that a citrus tip isoform cstip2;1 is highly expressed in leaves and also transcriptionally regulated in leaves and roots by salt and drought stresses and infection by 'candidatus liberibacter asiaticus' the causal agent of the huanglongbing disease suggesting its involvement in the regulation of the flow of water and nutrients required during both normal growth and stress conditions here we show that the overexpression of cstip2;1 in transgenic tobacco increases plant growth under optimal and water and saltstress conditions and also significantly improves the leaf water and oxidative status photosynthetic capacity transpiration rate and water use efficiency of plants subjected to a progressive soil drying these results correlated with the enhanced mesophyll cell expansion midrib aquiferous parenchyma abundance h2o2 detoxification and stomatal conductance observed in the transgenic plants taken together our results indicate that cstip2;1 plays an active role in regulating the water and oxidative status required for plant growth and adaptation to stressful environmental conditions and may be potentially useful for engineering stress tolerance in citrus and other crop plants

improvements in biomedical technologies combined with changing social attitudes to sexual minorities provide new opportunities for hiv prevention among gay and other men who have sex with men gmsm the potential of these new biomedical technologies biotechnologies to reduce hiv transmission and the impact of hiv among gmsm will depend in part on the degree to which they challenge prejudicial attitudes practices and stigma directed against gay men and people living with hiv plhiv at the structural level stigma regarding gay men and hiv can influence the scaleup of new biotechnologies and negatively affect gmsm's access to and use of these technologies at the personal level stigma can affect individual gay men's sense of value and confidence as they negotiate serodiscordant relationships or access services this paper argues that maximising the benefits of new biomedical technologies depends on reducing stigma directed at sexual minorities and people living with hiv and promoting positive social changes towards and within gmsm communities hiv research policy and programs will need to invest in: 1 responding to structural and institutional stigma; 2 health promotion and health services that recognise and work to address the impact of stigma on gmsm's incorporation of new hiv prevention biotechnologies; 3 enhanced mobilisation and participation of gmsm and plhiv in new approaches to hiv prevention; and 4 expanded approaches to research and evaluation in stigma reduction and its relationship with hiv prevention the hiv response must become bolder in resourcing designing and evaluating programs that interact with and influence stigma at multiple levels including structurallevel stigma
computeraided inspection cai of nonrigid parts significantly contributes to improving performance of products reducing assembly time and decreasing production costs cai methods use scanners to measure point clouds on parts and compare them with the nominal computeraided design cad model due to the compliance of nonrigid parts and for inspection in supplier and client facilities two sets of sophisticated and expensive dedicated fixtures are usually required to compensate for the deformation of these parts during inspection cai methods for fixtureless inspection of nonrigid parts aim at scanning these parts in a freestate for which one of the main challenges is to distinguish between possible geometric deviation defects and flexible deformation associated with freestate in this work the generalized inspection fixture gnif method is applied to generate a prior set of corresponding sample points between cad and scanned models these points are used to deform the cad model to the scanned model via finite element nonrigid registration then defects are identified by comparing the deformed cad model with the scanned model the fact that some sample points can be located close to defects results in an inaccurate estimation of these defects in this paper a method is introduced to automatically filter out sample points that are close to defects this method is based on curvature and von mises stress once filtered the remaining sample points are used in a new registration which allows identifying and quantifying defects more accurately the proposed method is validated on aerospace parts
recently rainwater harvesting systems have received increased attention due to their capability for adapting to water scarcity and climate change however a key obstacle to the implementation of rainwater harvesting systems is that they are often not financially feasible given difficulty in determining optimal system size a key premise of previous studies was that all rainwater harvesting systems are constructed in a single construction event even though it is possible to construct a system in multiple stages this assumption limits managerial flexibility in the construction of rainwater harvesting systems which is particularly valuable in scenarios where it is difficult to forecast future rainfall patterns therefore we propose a multistage system expansion strategy for the implementation of rainwater harvesting systems using decommissioned septic tanks under scenarios of uncertainty in rainfall from a real option perspective as a means to improve the financial feasibility of implementing rainwater harvesting systems we tested this strategy by evaluating a proposed rainwater harvesting system for a midsize apartment complex in jeonju south korea the multistage expansion strategy generated an option value of 9 896 usd this study will help to improve the financial feasibility of rainwater harvesting systems by adding the value of managerial flexibility through a sequential expansion of rwh systems as new information becomes available

background: mesenchymal stem cells mscs show therapeutic efficacy in many different agerelated degenerative diseases including alzheimer's disease very little is currently known about whether or not aging impacts the transplantation efficiency of mscs methods: in this study we investigated the distribution of intravenously transplanted syngeneic mscs derived from young and aged mice into young aged and transgenic app/ps1 alzheimer's disease mice mscs from male donors were transplanted into female mice and their distribution pattern was monitored by pcr using ychromosome specific probes biodistribution of transplanted mscs in the brains of app/ps1 mice was additionally confirmed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy results: four weeks after transplantation into young mice young mscs were found in the lung axillary lymph nodes blood kidney bone marrow spleen liver heart and brain cortex in contrast young mscs that were transplanted into aged mice were only found in the brain cortex in both young and aged mouse recipients transplantation of aged mscs showed biodistribution only in the blood and spleen although young transplanted mscs only showed neuronal distribution in the brain cortex in young mice they exhibited a wide neuronal distribution pattern in the brains of app/ps1 mice and were found in the cortex cerebellum hippocampus olfactory bulb and brainstem the immunofluorescent signal of both transplanted mscs and resident microglia was robust in the brains of app/ps1 mice monocyte chemoattractant1 levels were lowest in the brain cortex of young mice and were significantly increased in app/ps1 mice within the hippocampus monocyte chemoattractant1 levels were significantly higher in aged mice compared with younger and app/ps1 mice conclusions: we demonstrate in vivo that msc biodistribution post transplantation is detrimentally affected by aging and neuronal health aging of both the recipient and the donor mscs used attenuates transplantation efficiency clinically our data would suggest that aged mscs should not be used for transplantation and that transplantation of mscs into aged patients will be less efficacious
the gene encoding a cellobiohydrolase 7b cbh7b of the thermophilic fungus thielavia terrestris was identified subcloned and expressed in pichia pastoris cbh7b encoded 455 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 518 kda domain analysis indicated that cbh7b contains a family 7 glycosyl hydrolase catalytic core but lacks a carbohydratebinding module purified cbh7b exhibited optimum catalytic activity at ph 50 and 55 degrees c with 4methylumbelliferrylcellobioside as the substrate and retained 85% of its activity following 24 h incubation at 50 degrees c despite the lack of activity toward microcrystalline substrates this enzyme worked synergistically with the commercial enzyme cocktail cellic r ctec2 to enhance saccharification by 39% when added to a reaction mixture containing 025% alkaline pretreated oil palm empty fruit bunch opefb attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested a reduction of lignin and crystalline cellulose in opefb samples supplemented with cbh7b scanning electron microscopy revealed greater destruction extent of opefb strands in samples supplemented with cbh7b as compared with the nonsupplemented control therefore cbh7b has the potential to complement commercial enzymes in hydrolyzing lignocellulosic biomass c 2015 international union of biochemistry and molecular biology inc
most research on threat documents its negative consequences similarly most research on intergroup contexts has emphasized their negative behavioral effects drawing on the meaning maintenance model and recent perspectives on the potential for positivity in intergroup conflict we predicted that meaning threat can produce both antisocial and prosocial responses to intergroup conflict depending on people's preexisting meaning frameworks studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that under meaning threat low ingroup glorifiers strengthened their support for peaceful conflict resolution whereas high ingroup glorifiers strengthened their support for militarybased conflict resolution in the context of the israelpalestinian conflict study 3 found that low glorification was associated with greater support for peace during hot but not cold conflict because hot conflict reduced their meaning in life these findings are consistent with the notion that when meaning is threatened people affirm their preexisting valueswhether prosocial or antisocialeven in the context of intergroup conflict
although traditional economic models posit that money is fungible psychological research abounds with examples that deviate from this assumption across eight experiments we provide evidence that people construe physical currency as carrying traces of its moral history in experiments 1 and 2 people report being less likely to want money with negative moral history ie stolen money experiments 35 provide evidence against an alternative account that people's judgments merely reflect beliefs about the consequences of accepting stolen money rather than moral sensitivity experiment 6 examines whether an aversion to stolen money may reflect contamination concerns and experiment 7 indicates that people report they would donate stolen money thereby counteracting its negative history with a positive act finally experiment 8 demonstrates that even in their recall of actual events people report a reduced tendency to accept tainted money altogether these findings suggest a robust tendency to evaluate money based on its moral history even though it is designed to participate in exchanges that effectively erase its origins
ambient intelligence aml worlds consist of heterogeneous collections of interconnected devices that integrate smoothly in the environment to offer services to their users these devices can be added change or fail modifying the system topology also other circumstances may change affecting users' activities eg time location or the presence of other users these changes modify the information the system has available to satisfy users' needs ie the context aml systems need to adapt to these evolving conditions in order to be able to provide their services but being as unobtrusive as possible for their users there are also performance requirements that the system must fulfill to provide responses to environment stimuli in real time opportunistic control mechanisms address these issues by monitoring the context and suspending or resolving goals when the appropriate conditions are met this paper presents faerie a software framework that supports the development of aml applications with facilities for context management that rely on opportunistic control the development of faerie systems uses a 3d simulator tool for testing and validation called ubiksim a case study on an artistic installation illustrates the use of this infrastructure c 2013 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

following the dominant firmcompetitive fringe model this paper analyses the response of japan's nonrenewable electricity utilities to the renewable portfolio standards rps and feedin tariff fit scheme the output of electricity from renewable energy sources rese is primarily correlated with the magnitude of the rps requirement and the fixed tariff nonrenewable firms suffer a reduction in revenue due to increased rese production under both schemes the rps requirement has direct impact on the renewable energy certificate nec price if the incumbent nonrenewable electricity utilities gain market power in both electricity and nec markets they can suppress the rps quota to preserve their vested benefits in the fit scheme the abovemarket rese generation cost is passed on to consumers via a surcharge since gridconnected rese accelerated rapidly under fit nonrenewable electricity utilities would face a substantial increase in costs to maintain network reliability due to the intermittent and variable nature of rese technologies the japanese government should therefore take measures to ensure variable renewable power occupies a higher share of the electricity system and to do so in a costeffective manner c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

pyrethroid chemicals are attractive alternatives to the organophosphates ops because of their selective toxicity against pests rather than mammals the carboxylesterases ces are hepatic enzymes that metabolize estercontaining xenobiotics such as pyrethroids the primary aim of this study was to gain insight into the catalytic properties of the ce enzymes in humans that metabolize pyrethroids while a secondary aim was to investigate pyrethroid metabolism using ces from other mammalian species pure human ces hce1 and hce2 a rabbit ce rce and two rat ces hydrolases a and b were used to study the hydrolytic metabolism of the following pyrethroids: 1r transresmethrin bioresmethrin 1rs transpermethrin and 1rs cispermethrin hce1 and hce2 hydrolyzed transpermethrin 8 and 28fold more efficiently than cispermethrin when k cat /km values were compared respectively in contrast hydrolysis of bioresmethrin was catalyzed efficiently by hce1 but not by hce2 the kinetic parameters for the pure rat and rabbit ces were qualitatively similar to the human ces when hydrolysis rates of the investigated pyrethroids were evaluated further a comparison of pyrethroid hydrolysis by hepatic microsomes from rats mice and humans indicated that the rates for each compound were similar between species which further supports the use of rodent models for pyrethroid metabolism studies an eightfold range in hydrolytic rates for 11 individual human liver samples toward transpermethrin was also found although this variability was not related to the levels of hce1 protein in each sample we also determined that the ce inhibitor 2chloro3 4dimethoxybenzil blocked hce2catalyzed transpermethrin hydrolysis 36 times more potently than hce1 thus this inhibitor will be useful in future studies that examine cemediated metabolism of pyrethroids while there are likely other esterases in human liver that hydrolyze pyrethroids the results of this study clearly demonstrate that hce1 and hce2 are human pyrethroidhydrolyzing ces c 2005 elsevier inc all rights reserved

it has been stated that roughly 50% of electrical incidents involve workers whose primary function is not electrical in nature it also encouraged all to address electrical safety for all workers and not just workers whose job responsibilities involve working on or near energized electrical circuits in this paper a program which includes specific briefings to nonelectrical workers as well as to workers who may need to perform their normal activities in proximity to energized electrical conductors is presented the program uses a targeted approach to specific areas such as welding excavating rigging chart reading switching cord and plug equipment and several other general areas to point out hazards that may exist and how to avoid them the site experience over the years supports the assertion that about half of the electrical incidents involve nonelectrical workers and this prompted us to develop specific briefings to enhance the knowledge of the nonelectrical worker regarding safe electrical practices the promotion of may is electrical safety month and the development of informative presentations which are delivered to the general site population as well as electrical workers have greatly improved the hazards awareness status of the general worker on site
lcl filters have been widely used for gridconnected inverters however the problem that how time delay affects the stability of digitally controlled gridconnected inverters with lcl filters has not been fully studied in this paper a systematic study is carried out on the relationship between the time delay and stability of singleloop controlled gridconnected inverters that employ inverter current feedback icf or grid current feedback gcf the ranges of time delay for system stability are analyzed and deduced in the continuous sdomain and discrete zdomain it is shown that in the optimal range the existence of time delay weakens the stability of the icf loop whereas a proper time delay is required for the gcf loop the present work explains for the first time why different conclusions on the stability of icf loop and gcf loop have been drawn in previous studies to improve system stability a linear predictorbased time delay reduction method is proposed for icf while a time delay addition method is used for gcf a controller design method is then presented that guarantees adequate stability margins the delaydependent stability study is verified by simulation and experiment
this paper proposes a numerical method for accurate timedomain noise simulation of mixed analogue/digital electrical circuits that in principle do not admit a periodic steadystate working condition such as fractional sigma phaselocked loops plls by means of a tool known as saltation matrix which allows dealing with nonsmooth vector fields a variational approach is adopted the power spectral density of a noisy electrical variable is computed by applying the thomson's multitaper method mtm to the numerical solution of the stochastic variational model of the circuit this allows to resort to a single transient simulation run thus avoiding cpu time consuming montecarlolike approaches the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by comparing simulation results related to a commercial fractional sigma pll with experimental data

the aim of this case report was to describe an innovative orthodontic treatment method that combined surgical and orthodontic techniques the novel method was used to achieve a positive result in a case of moderate crowding by employing a computerguided piezocision procedure followed by the use of clear aligners a 23yearold woman had a malocclusion with moderate crowding her periodontal indices oral healthrelated quality of life ohrqol and treatment time were evaluated the treatment included interproximal corticotomy cuts extending through the entire thickness of the cortical layer without a full thickness flap reflection this was achieved with a threedimensionally printed surgical guide using computeraided design and computeraided manufacturing orthodontic force was applied to the teeth immediately after surgery by using clear appliances for better control of tooth movement the total treatment time was 8 months the periodontal indices improved after crowding correction but the oral health impact profile showed a slight deterioration of ohrqol during the 3 daysfollowing surgery at the 2year retention followup the stability of treatment was excellent the reduction in surgical time and patient discomfort increased periodontal safety and patient acceptability and accurate control of orthodontic movement without the risk of losing anchorage may encourage the use of this combined technique in appropriate cases
recognition of texts in scenes is one of the most important tasks in many computer vision applications though different scene text recognition techniques have been developed scene text recognition under a generic condition is still a very open and challenging research problem one major factor that defers the advance in this research area is character touching where many characters in scene images are heavily touched with each other and cannot be segmented for recognition in this paper we proposed a novel scene text recognition technique that performs word level recognition without character segmentation our proposed technique has three advantages first it converts each word image into a sequential signal for the scene text recognition second it adapts the recurrent neural network rnn with long short term memory lstm the technique that has been widely used for handwriting recognition in recent years third by integrating multiple rnns an accurate recognition system is developed which is capable of recognizing scene texts including those heavily touched ones without character segmentation extensive experiments have been conducted over a number of datasets including several icdar robust reading datasets and google street view dataset experiments show that the proposed technique is capable of recognizing texts in scenes accurately
while attributional style is regarded as a core domain of social cognition questions persist about the psychometric characteristics of measures used to assess it one widely used assessment of attributional style is the ambiguous intentions hostility questionnaire aihq two limitations of the aihq include 1 a possible restricted range resulting from too few and too homogenous item scenarios and 2 use of rater scores that are cumbersome and timeconsuming to score and have unknown incremental validity the present study evaluated the psychometric properties of the aihq while concurrently testing changes aiming to improve the scale in particular expansion of the number of selfreport items and removal of the raterscored items one hundred sixty individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and 58 healthy controls completed the full aihq along with measures of symptoms functioning and verbal intelligence the aihq particularly the selfreported blame score demonstrated adequate internal consistency testretest reliability and distinguished patients from controls it also was significantly related to clinicallyrated hostility and suspiciousness symptoms and correlated with functional capacity even after controlling for verbal intelligence incremental validity analyses suggested that a higher number of selfreport items strengthens relationships to outcomes in a manner that justifies this expansion while raterscored items had mixed results in providing additional information beyond selfreport in the aihq c 2017 published by elsevier ltd

research suggests that benefiting from someone's voluntary intentional costly effort encourages reciprocal prosocial behavior as well as promoting upstream reciprocity that is increases reciprocal actions by the recipient for the benefit of an unrelated third party the current study examines the role of the identifiability of the benefactor in determining the extent to which people engage in direct and upstream reciprocity results of three studies reveal that while an identified benefactor tends to engender greater direct reciprocal reactions than an unidentified one this strong reaction toward the identified benefactor does not hold to the same extent when upstream reciprocity is considered regardless of identification of the third party on the other hand when the benefactor is unidentified levels of direct and upstream reciprocity remain similar moderatedmediation analysis suggests that ethical commitment associated with the universal norm of reciprocity explains the decrease in prosociality between reactions toward the benefactor himself or herself and toward a third party under the identified condition copyright c 2016 john wiley & sons ltd
exploratory research was performed on a promising safety intervention concept prevention through design ptd also known as designing for construction safety dfcs the overall research goal was to increase understanding of the role that owners of constructed facilities can play in adopting ptd on their capital projects a total of 65 facetoface interviews and 79 anonymous surveys were completed at four casestudy organizations in addition to 103 surveys completed online by members of national construction associations and organizations industry survey data indicate that while the majority of owner firm employees had not heard of ptd they find the concept compelling and do not anticipate significant barriers to its implementation key empirical findings indicate that 1 an explicit ptd process is required for implementation; 2 proactive owner leadership and involvement are necessary to initiate ptd on a project; 3 owner leadership is required both to set high expectations for worker safety and health and to ensure general contractor and trade contractor personnel participation in the design review process; and 4 supporting tools such as design checklists four dimensional 4d computeraided design cad systems and risk identification and assessment documents facilitate the ptd process these findings can be used by owners to most effectively implement a ptd program on one or more of their projects c 2016 american society of civil engineers
feedback indicating how well students are performing during a learning task can be very stimulating in this study with a pre and posttest design the effects of two types of performance feedback on learning results were compared: feedback during a learning task was either stated in terms of how well the students were performing relative to other students social comparison feedback or relative to an absolute criterion criterionbased feedback thirtyfour students in secondary vocational engineering education were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in both conditions students worked together in small groups all groups completed a math learning task during which they received either social comparison feedback or criterionbased performance feedback the findings showed that the type of feedback had a strong effect on learning outcomes: the posttest scores and gains of students in the social comparison condition were significantly higher than those of students in the criterionbased feedback condition

colorectal cancer is one of the most common types of inflammationbased cancers and is occurred due to growth and spread of cancer cells in colon and/or rectum previously genetic association of cell cycle genes both protooncogenes and the tumor suppressors has been proved but there were few studies about association of immune related genes such as killercell immunoglobulinlike receptors kirs thus we intend to perform a metaanalysis to find the association of different genes of kir and susceptibility to be affected by colorectal cancer the overall population of the four studies investigated in ourmetaanalysis was 953 individuals 470 individuals with colorectal cancer and 483 individuals in control groups after the analyses we concluded that colorectal cancer is affected by kir2ds5 and also there were no protecting gene this result shows the inflammatory basis of this cancer in other words in contrast to leukemia and blood cancers colorectal cancers seem to be affected by hyper activity of natural killercells nks whys and therefore of this paradox is suggested to be investigated further c 2016 published by elsevier inc
inherited genetic variants contribute to risk factors for developing an alcohol use disorder and polymorphisms may inform precision medicine strategies for treating alcohol addiction targeting genetic mutations linked to alcohol phenotypes has provided promising initial evidence for reducing relapse rates in alcoholics although successful in some studies there are conflicting findings and the reports of adverse effects may ultimately limit their clinical utility suggesting that novel pharmacogenetic targets are necessary to advance precision medicine approaches here we describe promising novel genetic variants derived from preclinical models of alcohol consumption and dependence that may uncover disease mechanisms that drive uncontrolled drinking and identify novel pharmacogenetic targets that facilitate therapeutic intervention for the treatment of alcohol use disorder
the thermal hydraulics of supercritical water under forced mixed convection and natural circulation conditions is not fully understood in order to study the thermal hydraulic behaviour of this fluid under natural circulation conditions a small size closed experimental loop has been designed and built the thermal hydraulic phenomenon occurring in the loop can be measured by thermocouples mounted onto the outer surface of the heated tube wall absolute and differential pressure transducers and a flow meter; moreover simultaneously can be visualized by neutron radiography techniques this paper describes the loop itself the process of the experiment with the measurement techniques the data acquisition system applied and the results got during the first measurement series based on the results of the first measurement series it was found that the measured part of the steady state characteristic is independent from the system pressure a slight dependence of steady state characteristic on the inlet temperature can be identified: the higher the inlet temperature the higher the mass flow rate the total pressure drop and its components seem to be independent from the system pressure but strongly dependent on the inlet temperature due to the influence of bulkfluid temperature on the relevant thermophysical properties density and dynamic viscosity the pressure drop due to acceleration of flow found to be negligible next to the two dominant components the pressure drop due to frictional resistance and due to gravity the coupled evaluation of the radiographic images and the thermophysical properties of wafer have shown that the main driving force behind the decrease of the neutron attenuation is the decreasing water density as the bulkfluid temperature increases the reverse of this relationship could be exploited during the validation of future monte carlo simulations c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

random forest rf is a widely used classifier to show a good performance of hyperspectral data classification however such performance could be improved by increasing the diversity that characterizes the ensemble architecture in this paper we propose a novel ensemble approach namely rotation random forest via kernel principal component analysis rorfkpca in particular the original feature space is first randomly split into several subsets and kpca is performed on each subset to extract high order statistics the obtained feature sets are merged and used as input to an rf classifier finally the results achieved at each step are fused by a majority vote experimental analysis is conducted using real hyperspectral remote sensing images to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with rf rotation forest support vector machines and rorfpca the obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
noise and vibration of electrical machines is a major concern changes in the machine design to improve its efficiency can lead to unacceptable vibrations tools to predict its vibratory and acoustic performance at the design stage need to be developed an improved finite element model has been developed to analyse the vibration behaviour of a permanent magnet synchronous motor pmsm using the finite element software abaqus all components and subsets of the machine have been modelled and validated by experimental modal analysis ema performed on them some modelling issues have been overcome so that an accurate enough model has been reached the laminated stator as it is formed by a pack of several steel sheets has been treated as an orthotropic material and windings have been considered a solid orthotropic part as well the rotorshaft assembly has also been verified by ema the bearings that join the rotor to the assembly of the stator have been represented by radial springs the electromagnetic forces are applied to the whole machine model in order to obtain the vibration response these forces are obtained from the magnetic airgap flux density which has been obtained with a 2d finite element model developed by flux finally the vibration response has been used to calculate the radiated noise with an acoustic model developed in lms virtual lab the results given by the acoustic numerical model are compared with sound power measurements
the mechanism of tacrine as a precognitive drug has been considered to be complex and not fully understood it has been reported to involve a wide spectrum of targets involving cholinergic gabaergic nitrinergic and glutamatergic pathways here we review the effect of tacrine and its derivatives on the nmda receptors nmdar with a focus on the mechanism of action and biological consequences related to the alzheimer's disease treatment our findings indicate that effect of tacrine on glutamatergic neurons is both direct and indirect direct nmdar antagonistic effect is often reported by in vitro studies; however it is achieved by high tacrine concentrations which are not likely to occur under clinical conditions the impact on memory and behavioral testing can be ascribed to indirect effects of tacrine caused by influencing the nmdarmediated currents via ml receptor activation which leads to inhibition of ca2+activated potassium channels such inhibition prevents membrane re polarization leading to prolonged nmdar activation and subsequently to long term potentiation considering these findings we can conclude that tacrinederivatives with dual cholinesterase and nmdars modulating activity may represent a promising approach in the drug development for diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction such as the alzheimer disease c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved
objective: since reconstruction of composite defects in the head and neck region is a challenging and demanding problem for head and neck surgeons surgical aids have been sought for decades the purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of prefabricated surgical resection templates used in mandibular segmental resections in comparison to the virtual surgical plan materials and methods: a prospective study was performed in 11 consecutive patients with a primary t4 oral squamous cell carcinoma or osteoradionecrosis of the mandible preoperatively a cbct scan was acquired to delineate the size and extension of tumor invasion; a virtual patientspecific resection template was designed based on this information intraoperatively the resection template was positioned on the mandible and secured using four fixation screws postoperatively a cbct scan was acquired this scan was superimposed on the preoperative scan positioning of the resection template and inclination of the resection planes were evaluated on the virtual head model in order to test the interobserver reliability of these new measurement methods two different observers executed all measurements results: the mean shift of the proximal resection templates was 376 mm standard deviation sd 310 mm for the distal resection templates the mean shift was 306 mm sd 157 mm with no significant interobserver difference icc 099 an absolute mean deviation of 85 degrees sd 53 degrees was found for the proximal resection angle and 104 degrees sd 50 degrees for the distal resection angle again no significant interobserver differences were found icc 098 conclusion: the resection templates used in this study proved reasonably accurate although the concept of virtual surgical planning aids significantly in mandibular reconstruction with microvascular free flaps further improvement of resection accuracy is necessary for further improvement of reconstruction accuracy c 2016 published by elsevier ltd on behalf of european association for craniomaxillofacial surgery

northeastern mexico is a semiarid region with water scarcity and a strong pressure on water sources caused by the rapid increase of population and industrialization in this region rainwater harvesting alone is not enough to meet water supply demands due to the irregular distribution of rainfall in time and space thus in this study the reliability of integrating rainwater harvesting with greywater reuse to reduce water consumption and minimize wastewater generation in the tecnologico de monterrey monterrey campus was assessed potable water consumption and greywater generation in main facilities of the campus were determined rainwater that can be potentially harvested in roofs and parking areas of the campus was estimated based on a statistical analysis of the rainfall based on these data potential water savings and wastewater minimization were determined characterization of rainwater and greywater was carried out to determine the treatment necessities for each water source additionally the capacity of water storage tanks was estimated for the selected treatment systems an economic assessment was conducted to determine the viability of the alternatives proposed results showed that water consumption can be reduced by 48% and wastewater generation can be minimized by 59% implementation of rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse systems in the monterrey campus will generate important economic benefits to the institution amortization of the investments will be achieved in only six years where the net present value npv will be on the order of us $50 4832 the internal rate of return irr of 46% and the benefitsinvestment ratio b/i of 17 from the seventh year the project will present an irr greater than the minimum acceptable rate of return marr in a decade the irr will be 144% more than twice the marr the npv of us $ 290 4121 and the b/i of 31 denoting economic feasibility based on these results it is clear that integrating rainwater harvesting with greywater reuse resulted in a more feasible and reliable strategy than those strategies based only on rainwater harvesting furthermore the investments can be amortized in a shorter period of time
twentyone populations 555 individuals covering the entire native range of pinus mugo turra dwarf mountain pine were investigated for genetic variation scored at 13 nuclear microsatellite markers nssrs the main objective of the present study was to determine the genetic structure across the present distribution of the species and locate populations of different genetic compositions most of the genetic variation was observed within the populations 95% the assignment of populations based on bayesian clustering methods revealed that the sudeten populations of p mugo form a separate genetic cluster these stands have likely been established through the founder effects of alpine migrants the distribution and level of ssr polymorphisms along with no evidence of isolation by distance or phylogeographic structure indicate that the present populations of p mugo have diverged relatively recently and originate from a larger glacial distribution of the species one peripheral stand from italy had the lowest values of most calculated genetic variation indices this stand could therefore be more susceptible to genetic drift and a negative impact of predicted environmental changes we discuss our findings with respect to previously published results on the genetic and morphological variation of p mugo and with consideration for the conservation genetics of the species
how evolutionary novelties evolve is a major question in evolutionary biology it is widely accepted that changes in environmental conditions shift the position of selective optima and advancements in phylogenetic comparative approaches allow the rigorous testing of such correlated transitions a longstanding question in vertebrate biology has been the evolution of terrestrial life histories in amphibians and here by investigating african bufonids we test whether terrestrial modes of reproduction have evolved as adaptations to particular abiotic habitat parameters we reconstruct and date the most complete specieslevel molecular phylogeny and estimate ancestral states for reproductive modes by correlating continuous habitat measurements from remote sensing data and locality records with lifehistory transitions we discover that terrestrial modes of reproduction including viviparity evolved multiple times in this group most often directly from fully aquatic modes terrestrial modes of reproduction are strongly correlated with steep terrain and low availability of accumulated water sources evolutionary transitions to terrestrial modes of reproduction occurred synchronously with or after transitions in habitat and we therefore interpret terrestrial breeding as an adaptation to these abiotic conditions rather than an exaptation that facilitated the colonization of montane habitats

diencephalic defects underlie an array of neurological diseases previous studies have suggested that retinoic acid ra signaling is involved in diencephalic development at late stages of embryonic development but its roles and mechanisms of action during early neural development are still unclear here we demonstrate that mice lacking enzymatic activity of the acetyltransferase gcn5 gcn5 hat/hat which were previously characterized with respect to their exencephalic phenotype exhibit significant diencephalic expansion decreased diencephalic ra signaling and increased diencephalic wnt and shh signaling using a variety of molecular biology techniques in both cultured neuroepithelial cells treated with a gcn5 inhibitor and forebrain tissue from gcn5 hat/hat embryos we demonstrate that gcn5 rar alpha/gamma and the poorly characterized protein tacc1 form a complex in the nucleus that binds specific retinoic acid response elements in the absence of ra furthermore ra triggers gcn5mediated acetylation of tacc1 which results in dissociation of tacc1 from retinoic acid response elements and leads to transcriptional activation of ra target genes intriguingly ra signaling defects caused by in vitro inhibition of gcn5 can be rescued through radependent mechanisms that require rar beta last we demonstrate that the diencephalic expansion and transcriptional defects seen in gcn5 hat/hat mutants can be rescued with gestational ra supplementation supporting a direct link between gcn5 tacc1 and ra signaling in the developing diencephalon together our studies identify a novel nonhistone substrate for gcn5 whose modification regulates a previously undescribed tissuespecific mechanism of ra signaling that is required to restrict diencephalic size during early forebrain development

why is drug resistance common and vaccine resistance rare? drugs and vaccines both impose substantial pressure on pathogen populations to evolve resistance and indeed drug resistance typically emerges soon after the introduction of a drug but vaccine resistance has only rarely emerged using wellestablished principles of population genetics and evolutionary ecology we argue that two key differences between vaccines and drugs explain why vaccines have so far proved more robust against evolution than drugs first vaccines tend to work prophylactically while drugs tend to work therapeutically second vaccines tend to induce immune responses against multiple targets on a pathogen while drugs tend to target very few consequently pathogen populations generate less variation for vaccine resistance than they do for drug resistance and selection has fewer opportunities to act on that variation when vaccine resistance has evolved these generalities have been violated with careful forethought it may be possible to identify vaccines at risk of failure even before they are introduced
light weight engineering and composite technologies are key strategies in modem product development in mechanical engineering as well as in biomedical applications where innovation is driven by novel material concepts and surface functionalities designed or customized surface properties by advanced coating technologies are an important discipline in this context ceramic metallurgical and cermet layers can be manufactured in a most appropriate way by high energetic thermokinetic deposition techniques like plasma spraying electric arc and last not least by supersonic flame spraying hvof these technologies perform high deposition rates high flexibility to use various materials and their combinations and applications in micro to macro scale products the final properties of the coatings and layer composites do not just depend on the properties of the combined materials but as in the case of ceramic coated light metals are distinctly affected by the occurring residual stresses and their interaction with operational load stresses with respect to the complex geometries of most components their dimensional and positional tolerances a further strong influence of the robot kinematics of the plasma or hvof torches during coating manufacturing is observed by combining the expertise in materials and manufacturing engineering coatings and composites with high performance and reliability can be achieved this is shown in the development of functionally coated cylinder liners and crankcases for ultra light weight engines as well as for ceramic coated bioinert and biodegradable substrates in medical surgery it will be shown that cast engine block bores can be directly coated by using an automated hvof process obtaining improved coating results the internal coating process by hypersonic flame spraying is a superior technological alternative to the aps process for high quality cylinder liner and engine crankcase applications the applications of such ceramic and cermet coatings are not limited to automotive and biomedical applications i e for wear and friction properties or biomedical compatibility but can be used for tailored thermophysical electrophysical or catalytic properties in various technical systems
people with autism spectrum disorder asd have difficulties in identifying another person by face and voice this might contribute considerably to the development of social cognition and interaction difficulties the characteristics of the voice recognition deficit in asd are unknown here we used a comprehensive behavioral test battery to systematically investigate voice processing in highfunctioning asd n16 and typically developed pairwise matched controls n16 the asd group had particular difficulties with discriminating learning and recognizing unfamiliar voices while recognizing famous voices was relatively intact tests on acoustic processing abilities showed that the asd group had a specific deficit in vocal pitch perception that was dissociable from otherwise intact acoustic processing ie musical pitch musical and vocal timbre perception our results allow a characterization of the voice recognition deficit in asd: the findings indicate that in highfunctioning asd the difficulty to recognize voices is particularly pronounced for learning novel voices and the recognition of unfamiliar peoples' voices this pattern might be indicative of difficulties with integrating the acoustic characteristics of the voice into a coherent percepta function that has been previously associated with voiceselective regions in the posterior superior temporal sulcus/gyrus of the human brain autism res2017 10: 155168 c 2016 international society for autism research wiley periodicals inc

amino acids present a great potential for heavy metals sorption thanks to their active chemical groups tyrosine is an amino acid containing amine carboxylate and phenol groups and thus is a potential candidate for heavy metals remediation however this biomolecule is water soluble and so it is difficult to remove tyrosinemetal complexes from the water a potential solution would consist in grafting this biomolecule onto a material to ensure a good separation between heavy metals trapped by tyrosinegraftedmaterial and the water medium thus the grafting of tyrosine onto a polypropylene pp nonwoven was carried out evidence of the grafting of tyrosine was given by several characterization techniques: fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and xray photoelectron spectroscopy a 32% tyrosine grafting rate was obtained then the sorption efficiency of the tyrosinefunctionalized material was evaluated by flame atomic absorption spectrometry at 20 degrees c and for ph 45 approximately 48 mg of copper per gram of pp were trapped confirming the good efficiency of tyrosine the most interesting result of this study is the constant sorption capacity whatever the sodium chloride concentration in the copper sulfate solution this result specific to tyrosine allows considering the possibility of the use of such material for marine wastewaters and sediments depollution this article contains supporting information that will be made available online once the issue is published
this paper presents a case history on the performance of a coastal embankment reinforced by a layer of geotextile at the bottom of the embankment on soft marine deposits the coastal embankment is the sea wall of the qinshan nuclear power station on the northern side of hangzhou bay near shanghai china monitoring of settlement and excess pore water pressure were carried out during and after embankment construction the finite element method fem was used to analyse the performance of the geotextile reinforcement and its effect on soil behaviour under the embankment loading based on the field monitored results stability analyses were conducted using two approaches: cphi reduction in fem and limit equilibrium analysis both field and simulation results indicate that the geotextile has an effect on reducing the vertical displacements of subsoil however the results show basal reinforcement cannot increase the overall factor of safety but the factor of safety at the local position under reinforcement can be increased during the construction procedure and this is due to the confinement of the soil element by the reinforcing fabric thus in these circumstances one layer of basal geotextile reinforcement can prevent sudden failure of subsoil during embankment construction c 2015 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

part of the down syndrome behavioral phenotype is significant impairment in expressive communication this begins early with impairments in verbal imitation and requesting observed in infants with down syndrome in contrast social interaction is a relative strength we replicated intervention procedures using social reinforcement and prompting feeley et al 2011 to teach infants with down syndrome to imitate sounds and engage in increasingly sophisticated forms of social and instrumental requests and examined generalization and collateral changes in intelligibility and problem solving infants learned to imitate verbalizations and make requests they showed generalization by imitating novel sounds and requesting with different toys and on a semi structured assessment infants also showed verbal imitation that was intelligible to a naive listener and improvements in problem solving suggesting this intervention may have broader effects than just requesting and verbal imitation
objectives to determine whether treating conditions having medically unexplained symptoms is associated with lower physician satisfaction and higher ascribed patient responsibility and to determine whether higher ascribed patient responsibility is associated with lower physician satisfaction in treating a given condition methods we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1504 us primary care physicians respondents were asked how responsible patients are for two conditions with moredeveloped medical explanations depression and anxiety and two conditions with lessdeveloped medical explanations chronic back pain and fibromyalgia and how much satisfaction they experienced in treating each condition we used wald tests to compare mean satisfaction and ascribed patient responsibility between medically explained conditions and medically unexplained conditions we conducted singlelevel and multilevel ordinal logistic models to test the relation between ascribed patient responsibility and physician satisfaction results treating medically unexplained conditions elicited less satisfaction than treating medically explained conditions wald p < 0001 physicians attribute significantly more patient responsibility to the former wald p < 0005 although the magnitude of the difference is small across all four conditions physicians reported experiencing less satisfaction when treating symptoms that result from choices for which patients are responsible multilevel odds ratio 057 p 0000 conclusions physicians experience less satisfaction in treating conditions characterized by medically unexplained conditions and in treating conditions for which they believe the patient is responsible
this article examines the importance of being able to read body language signals in business negotiations observing physical body changes and gestures can lead to a more or less realistic impression about the opponent his feelings mood thoughts expectations intentions and their changes the most important aspects of nonverbal body language are: posture clothing accessories gestures eye contact facial expressions smile voice tone laughter eye contact eye signs the distance between the participants of the conversation touch clap dance and physiological response sweating palms or forehead paleness acute facial or neck redness etc some of the nonverbal communication signs or in other words body language signals are conscious either natural or pretended while others are communicated to the environment unintentionally with immediate instant and instinctive response to received information without any thinking body language signals in business negotiations are important in several aspects: they reveal the other person's or the opponent's physical and emotional state as well as its change; they complement reinforce or weaken the spoken words; they enable those who can read nonverbal communication signs to determine whether what was said is true more or less accurately

how are accuracy and assumed similarity associated in first impressions of personality? in a largescale video perception study accuracy and assumed similarity were strongly negatively associated across traits consistent with past research eg beer & watson 2008 however across perceivers and perceivertarget dyads the ability to perceive others accurately was independent of the tendency to assume similarity with others thus viewing others in general or specific others as overly similar to the self does not imply viewing them inaccurately in sum accuracy and assumed similarity are inversely related when examined across traits but are independent across perceivers and dyads c 2011 elsevier inc all rights reserved

though present in low numbers dendritic cells dcs are recognized as major players in the control of cancer by adaptive immunity the roles of cytotoxic cd8 + tcells and th1 helper cd4 + tcells are welldocumented in murine models of cancer and associated with a profound prognostic impact when infiltrating human tumors but less information is known about how these tcells gain access to the tumor or how they are primed to become tumorspecific here we highlight recent findings that demonstrate a vital role of cd103 + dcs which have been shown to be experts in crosspriming and the induction of antitumor immunity we also focus on two different mediators that impair the function of tumorassociated dcs: prostaglandin e2 and betacatenin both of these mediators seem to be important for the exclusion of tcells in the tumor microenvironment and may represent key pathways to target in optimized treatment regimens against cancer
scouring is a significant problem on river bank and coastal protection systems severe scouring can cause damaging consequences to geotextile tube embankment structures in this study five case scenarios of an embankment system supported by stacked geotextile tubes were analyzed using a commercially available finiteelement analysis software these case scenarios include 1 conventional geotextile tube stacking on ground base foundation; 2 geotextile tube stacking on gravel bedding foundation; 3 geotextile tube stacking on excavated foundation; 4 geotextile tube stacking on excavated foundation with gravel bedding; and 5 fortification of stacked geotextile tubes by riprap protection each case scenario is simulated under normal loading and critical loading conditions with and without scouring at the base toe of the embankment system results suggest that the potential problems that occur during scouring and critical states of the embankment system instigate failures that could destabilize the geotextile tube retaining structure among all the case scenarios considered additional fortification by riprap increases the performance and global stability of the geotextile tube embankment system c 2014 american society of civil engineers
recently the relationship between carbon dioxide emission co2 aggregate energy consumption ec and economic growth gdp has been widely studied by many researchers using different approaches but the results were conflicting such controversy may due to the efficiency of the applied statistical approaches and using different dataset the main objective of this experimental study is to examine the relationship between co2 ec and gdp using different data transformation forms natural logarithm versus inverse form in reducing the heteroscedasticity in panel data the panel data consist of 29 countries from two different economic levels of countries 17 developed versus 12 developing countries the data spanning from 1960 to 2008 a panel data approach is applied and estimations based on three models first of all the estimations are conducted by constructing three different models; first model is estimated by using the original data without any transformation while the second and third model use the natural logarithm log and inverse form to transform the data those two transformation forms are applied to reduce the heteroscedasticity problem the main findings show a strong relationship between the three variables the model with inverse function transformation is superior to the other two models using original data and log transformation as it has the highest r2 which illustrates that more than 84% of co2 emission can be explained by gdp and ec since ec and gdp are influential on the co2 emissions higher ec and lower gdp may lead to environmental problems such as air and water pollution therefore prevention action should be taken to minimize the environmental degradation

synthetic biology or chemical biology is a growing field to which the chemical synthesis of proteins particularly enzymes makes a fundamental contribution however the chemical synthesis of catalytically active proteins enzymes remains poorly documented because it is difficult to obtain enough material for biochemical experiments we chose calstabin a 107aminoacid proline isomerase as a model we synthesized the enzyme using the native chemical ligation approach and obtained several tens of milligrams the polypeptide was refolded properly and we characterized its biophysical properties measured its catalytic activity and then crystallized it in order to obtain its tridimensional structure after xray diffraction the refolded enzyme was compared to the recombinant wildtype enzyme in addition as a first step of validating the whole process we incorporated exotic amino acids into the nterminus surprisingly none of the changes altered the catalytic activities of the corresponding mutants using this body of techniques avenues are now open to further obtain enzymes modified with exotic amino acids in a way that is only barely accessible by molecular biology obtaining detailed information on the structurefunction relationship of enzymes reachable by complete chemical synthesis
neuroinflammation is a pathophysiological process present in a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer's disease huntington's disease parkinson's disease stroke traumatic brain injury including chronic traumatic encephalopathy and other agerelated cns disorders although there is still much debate about the initial trigger for some of these neurodegenerative disorders during the progression of disease broad range antiinflammatory drugs including cytokine suppressive antiinflammatory drugs csaids might be promising therapeutic options to limit neuroinflammation and improve the clinical outcome one of the most promising csaids is curcumin which modulates the activity of several transcription factors eg stat nfkappa b ap1 and their proinflammatory molecular signaling pathways however normal curcumin preparations demonstrate low bioavailability in vivo to increase bioavailability preparations of high bioavailability curcumin have been introduced to achieve therapeutically relevant concentrations in target tissues this literature review aims to summarize the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of different curcumin formulations

green fluorescent protein gfp and its variants are widely used tools for studying protein localization and dynamics of events such as cytoskeletal remodeling and vesicular trafficking in living cells quantitative methodologies using chimeric gfp fusions have been developed for many applications; however gfp is somewhat resistant to proteolysis thus its fluorescence persists in the lysosome/vacuole which can impede quantification of cargo trafficking in the endocytic pathway an alternative method for quantifying endocytosis and postendocytic trafficking events makes use of superecliptic phluorin a phsensitive variant of gfp that is quenched in acidic environments chimeric fusion of phluorin to the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane cargo proteins results in a dampening of fluorescence upon incorporation of the cargo into multivesicular bodies mvbs and delivery to the lysosome/vacuole lumen thus quenching of vacuolar fluorescence facilitates quantification of endocytosis and early events in the endocytic pathway this paper describes methods using phluorintagged cargos for quantification of endocytosis via fluorescence microscopy as well as populationbased assays using flow cytometry

crop water status is an important parameter for plant growth and yield performance in greenhouses thus early detection of water stress is essential for efficient crop management the dynamic response of plants to changes of their environment is called 'speaking plant' and multisensory platforms for remote sensing measurements offer the possibility to monitor in realtime the crop health status without affecting the crop and environmental conditions therefore aim of this work was to use crop reflectance and temperature measurements acquired remotely for crop water status assessment two different irrigation treatments were imposed in tomato plants grown in slabs filed with perlite namely tomato plants under no irrigation for a certain period; and wellwatered plants the plants were grown in a controlled growth chamber and measurements were carried out during august and september of 2014 crop reflectance measurements were carried out by two types of sensors: i a multispectral camera measuring the radiation reflected in three spectral bands centred between 590680 690830 and 8301000 nm regions and ii a spectroradiometer measuring the leaf reflected radiation from 350 to 2500 nm based on the above measurements several crop indices were calculated the results showed that crop reflectance increased due to water deficit with the detected reflectance increase being significant about 8 h following irrigation withholding the results of a first derivative analysis on the reflectance data showed that the spectral regions centred at 490510 530560 660670 and 730760 nm could be used for crop status monitoring in addition the results of the present study point out that sphotochemical reflectance index modified red simple ratio index and modified ratio normalized difference vegetation index could be used as an indicator of plant water stress since their values were correlated well with the substrate water content and the crop water stress index; the last being extensively used for crop water status assessment in greenhouses and open field thus it could be concluded that reflectance and crop temperature measurements might be combined to provide alarm signals when crop water status reaches critical levels for optimal plant growth
much of the research on birth order has focused on individual differences in personality traits with relatively few studies focused on aspects of social behavior other than sibling conflict however one would predict that the differences in parental investment and niche differentiation that shape personality differences between siblings would also influence other social relationships in particular middleborns may be more likely to prioritize nonkin relationships this study investigated the impact of birth order on a number of measures of prosocial behavior results suggest that birth order has a moderate effect on prosociality such that later birth orders exhibit greater prosociality however both the linear and quadratic effects were significant and the quadratic was negative indicating that the greatest increase in prosociality is seen between first and secondborns the rate of change decelerates as birth order and prosociality increase c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
primary objective: there is considerable evidence suggesting facial affect recognition and cognitive functions are impaired in many people with moderatetosevere traumatic brain injury tbi however little is known about the relationship between these two domains in the tbi population research design: this study investigated the relationship between facial affect recognition and cognitive functioning in 75 adults with moderatetosevere tbi methods and procedures: participants were administered three facial affect recognition tests and a computerized cognitive test battery that assessed seven cognitive domains main outcomes and results: deficits in facial affect recognition were significantly correlated with impairments in nonverbal memory working memory speed of processing verbal memory and verbal delayed memory no significant relationship was found between executive dysfunction and facial affect recognition impairments nonverbal memory working memory and speed of processing significantly predicted overall facial affect recognition performance conclusions: it is concluded that impairment in several cognitive processes may contribute to facial affect recognition deficits in tbi in particular nonverbal memory working memory and speed of processing furthermore executive functioning may not be a critical factor in facial affect recognition but would most likely be important in deciding what to do once facial affect is perceived

when we communicate face to face we subconsciously engage our whole body to convey our message in telecommunication eg during phone calls this powerful information channel cannot be used capturing nonverbal information from body motion and transmitting it to the receiver parallel to speech would make these conversations feel much more natural this requires a sensing device that is capable of capturing different types of movements such as the flexion and extension of joints and the rotation of limbs in a first embodiment we developed a sensing glove that is used to control a computer game capacitive dielectric elastomer de sensors measure finger positions and an inertial measurement unit imu detects hand roll these two sensor technologies complement each other with the imu allowing the player to move an avatar through a threedimensional maze and the de sensors detecting finger flexion to fire weapons or open doors after demonstrating the potential of sensor fusion in humancomputer interaction we take this concept to the next level and apply it in nonverbal communication between humans the current fingerspelling glove prototype uses capacitive de sensors to detect finger gestures performed by the sending person these gestures are mapped to corresponding messages and transmitted wirelessly to another person a concept for integrating an imu into this system is presented the fusion of the de sensor and the imu combines the strengths of both sensor types and therefore enables very comprehensive body motion sensing which makes a large repertoire of gestures available to nonverbal communication over distances
many arylamine and hydrazine drugs and xenobiotics are acetylated by nacetyltransferase nat a cytosolic enzymic activity which has a wide tissue distribution humans can be classified as either fast or slow acetylators on the basis of their ability to metabolise isoniazid or sulphamethazine these are termed polymorphic substrates the acetylation of other compounds does not vary amongst individuals eg paminobenzoic acid and are termed monomorphic substrates nat from human hepatic and nonhepatic tissues viz i liver ii the hepatoma cell line hepg2 iii tonsil lymphocytes and iv the monocytic cell line u937 have been compared with respect to substrate specificity towards polymorphic and monomorphic substrates the chromatographic and centrifugation behaviour of nat from these sources has also been investigated nat from liver shows 2fold greater activity towards sulphamethazine than towards paminobenzoic acid as substrate all other cell types tested show at least 70fold greater activity with paminobenzoic as substrate compared to sulphamethazine nat from hepg2 cells u937 cells and tonsil lymphocytes migrates as a single peak during ionexchange chromatography whereas the liver nat activity is separated into two peaks nat in hepg2 cells resembles extrahepatic tissue nat rather than nat in liver hepg2 cells do not therefore represent a good in vitro model for investigation of human metabolism of arylamines or hydrazines the molecular weight of nat from u937 cells has been determined by a combination of sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration to be 31600 +/ 1200 daltons

in attempting to understand the increased rates of immoral behavior associated with psychopathic personality researchers have largely focused on identifying deficits such as reduced concerns for the wellbeing of others however we have little understanding of what does motivate individuals with psychopathic traits what do these individuals value in life and what goals do they aspire to? within a large online sample n 3 521 we examined relationships between psychopathic traits and several measures of values and goals overall psychopathy was related to both pleasureseeking and a desire for relative social positioning individuals scoring higher in psychopathy placed more value on seeking power but not necessarily personal achievement financial success and acquiring material possessions they demonstrated a preference for groupbased dominance social dominance orientation and were more concerned about their relative position in society than their absolute level of income education or vacation time this study may help us understand what motivates the behavior of individuals scoring higher in psychopathy by going beyond identifying deficits eg reduced concerns about the welfare of others and examining what these individuals do value we discuss ways in which this could be useful in developing treatments or interventions that take these motivations into account

narcissists relative to nonnarcissists seem to regard their own narcissistic traits eg rudeness and arrogance more positively and are more motivated to cultivate such traits that said should we expect narcissists to regard others' narcissistic traits more positively too? in this study participants n 463 completed a survey in which they responded on a measure of trait narcissism rated the likeability of people who possessed various narcissistic traits eg arrogant rude selfcentered and then indicated the extent to which they possessed the same narcissistic traits interestingly narcissists who are generally disagreeable and harsh individuals rated others who possessed narcissistic traits more positively than nonnarcissists furthermore a mediation analysis revealed that this effect of narcissism on ratings was mediated by narcissists' selfreports of possessing the narcissistic traits thus this study provides initial evidence that narcissists are more accepting of others' narcissistic traits and this study has implications for understanding the interpersonal and intrapersonal consequences of narcissism c 2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the popularity of mobile devices has been steadily growing in recent years these devices heavily depend on software from the underlying operating systems to the applications they run prior research showed that mobile software is different than traditional large software systems however to date most of our research has been conducted on traditional software systems very little work has focused on the issues that mobile developers face therefore in this paper we use data from the popular online q&a site stack overflow and analyze 13 232 821 posts to examine what mobile developers ask about we employ latent dirichlet allocationbased topic models to help us summarize the mobilerelated questions our findings show that developers are asking about app distribution mobile apis data management sensors and context mobile tools and user interface development we also determine what popular mobilerelated issues are the most difficult explore platform specific issues and investigate the types eg what how or why of questions mobile developers ask our findings help highlight the challenges facing mobile developers that require more attention from the software engineering research and development communities in the future and establish a novel approach for analyzing questions asked on q&a forums
the gap between yield potential and average farmers' yield measures the capacity for yield improvement with current technology the north china plain ncp is a major maize producing region of china and improving maize yield of ncp is essential to food security of the country some previous studies have found a substantial maize yield gap in this region similar to 100% of average yields whereas others have reported much smaller gaps this study used remote sensing estimated yield at 30m resolution to quantify county level yield distributions and then used these distributions to calculate yield gaps and the persistence level of yield for 76 counties in ncp the average yield was 866 t/ha across county years and the averaged countylevel yield gap as measured by the difference between the top 10 percentile of yields and the average yield of each county was 076 t/ha or 87% of the average yield when measured as the difference between maximum and average yields in each county the estimated gap increased to an average of 31% we also evaluated the persistence level of farmers' yield performance as an indicator of how much gap might be reduced by propagating agronomic practices of the highest yielding farmers the average of yield gap persistence was 259% of the average yield gap or 23% of average yield with a range from 04% to 53% across counties the distance to major rivers was identified as one factor with a significant effect on yield nevertheless there was tremendous spatial heterogeneity in yield persistence level across ncp and further analysis within individual counties is required to better prioritize means to shrink the yield gap c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved
people give widely varying estimates for the amount of genetic overlap that exists between humans while some laypeople believe that humans are highly genetically similar to one another others believe that humans share very little genetic overlap these studies examine how beliefs about genetic overlap affect neural and evaluative reactions to raciallyambiguous and biracial targets in study 1 we found that lower genetic overlap estimates predicted a stronger neural avoidance response to biracial compared to monoracial targets in study 2 we found that lower genetic overlap estimates predicted longer response times to classify biracial vs monoracial faces into racial categories in study 3 we manipulated genetic overlap beliefs and found that participants in the low overlap condition explicitly rated biracial targets more negatively than those in the high overlap condition taken together these data suggest that genetic overlap beliefs influence perceivers' processing fluency and evaluation of biracial and raciallyambiguous individuals

the cooccurrence of psychotic and autism spectrum disorder asd symptoms represents an important clinical challenge here we consider this problem in the context of a computational psychiatry approach that has been applied to both conditionspredictive coding some symptoms of schizophrenia have been explained in terms of a failure of topdown predictions or an enhanced weighting of bottomup prediction errors likewise autism has been explained in terms of similar perturbations we suggest that this theoretical overlap may explain overlapping symptomatology experimental evidence highlights meaningful distinctions and consistencies between these disorders we hypothesize individuals with asd may experience some degree of delusions without the presence of any additional impairment but that hallucinations are likely indicative of a distinct process
rainwater harvesting rwh systems are increasingly being implemented in buildings it is common in the uk for simple rwh tank sizing methods to be utilised and these do not consider future climate change this paper describes the development of a tool which integrates elements of basic and detailed sizing approaches from the british standard for rwh with the latest probabilistic uk climate projections data the method was initially applied to the design of a university building in cornwall uk the methodology utilises 3 000 equiprobable rainfall patterns for tank sizing for each time period results indicate that to ensure that it is 'likely' that the same nonpotable demand could be met in 2080 as in the present a tank 112% larger would be required this increases to a 225% oversizing for a 'very likely' probability of meeting the same level of nonpotable demand the same rwh system design was then assessed for three further uk locations with different rainfall characteristics from these assessments a simplified method was developed to enable practitioners to size rwh system tanks for current and future climates the method provides a new approach to meet present and future nonpotable demands while preventing excessive oversizing of tanks
recently an identitybased quadratic exponentiation randomized cryptosystem scheme using the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem has been developed their contribution lies in that they initiated an idea to create the identitybased cryptographic scheme without bilinear pair this scheme can achieve the security goal of protecting data and prevent the adversary from snooping the encrypted data and finding the secrete keys in this paper we have proposed some modification in setup phase using floor function and superincreasing sequence and modified the encryption and decryption process in the identitybased quadratic exponentiation randomized cryptographic scheme we also discuss how to enhance the security of proposed scheme and processing cost of the proposed scheme
background: asparaginase is an important component of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia all therapy unfortunately this treatment is hampered by hypersensitivity reactions in general allergies regardless of severity cause complete inactivation of the drug however we report atypical allergic reactions without inactivation of asparaginase here called allergiclike reactions procedure: patients with an allergiclike reaction who were treated according to the dutchchildhood oncology group all11 or the coall 0809 protocol were described the reactions were identified by continual measurement of asparaginase activity levels characteristics including timing of occurrence symptoms grade and the presence of antiasparaginase antibodies were compared to those of real allergies results: fourteen allergiclike reactions occurred in nine patients five reactions were to pegasparaginase and nine to erwinia asparaginase allergiclike reactions occurred relatively late after the start of infusion compared to real allergies antibodies were absent in all but one patient with an allergiclike reaction while they were detected in all patients with a real allergy symptoms and grade did not differ between the groups asparaginase was continued with the same formulation in six patients of whom four finished treatment with adequate activity levels conclusions: in conclusion allergiclike reactions occur relatively late after the start of infusion and without antibodies despite these clinical differences allergiclike reactions can only be distinguished from real allergies by continually measuring asparaginase activity levels if clinically tolerated formulations should not be switched in case of allergiclike reactions moreover failure to recognize these reactions may lead to a less favorable prognosis if asparaginase therapy is terminated unnecessarily
a new highperformance capillary electrophoresis assay for aminothiols in human blood including homocysteine a marker of several human metabolism disorders has been developed sample preparation involves conversion of disulfides to free thiols with triphenylphosphine precipitation of proteins with sulfosalicylic acid and conjugation of the thiols with monobromobimane derivatized thiols were separated in a sodium phosphate buffer using a fusedsilica capillary 65 cmx50 mum id at 30 degreesc with the electric field of 250 v cm 1 separation of homocysteine glutathione and cysteine occurred at less than 10 min detection at 250 or 234 nm was used to confirm the monobimanethiols peaks the detection limit was similar to5 nmol/ml for all labeled aminothiols the proposed method for these compounds' analysis included simple sample preparation high selectivity good linearity r 2 >0999 high reproducibility withinrun precision for derivatized aminothiol peaks area rsd<5% for three times consequently injected sample ; high reliability and the small volumes required for analysis made it suitable for clinical studies c 2000 elsevier science bv all rights reserved
vitaminb 12 is a generic term for corrinoid compounds that exhibit the biological activity of cyanocobalamin and are collectively referred to as cobalamins methylcobalamin and 5deoxyadenosylcobalamin are the active cobalamins in human metabolism cobalamin plays a crucial role in the maintenance of homocysteine and methylmalonylcoa homeostasis and is required for erythrocyte formation and dna synthesis data from human and animal studies indicate that cobalamin deficiency impairs neuronal function; a process that is thought to contribute to agerelated cognitive decline and dementia cobalamin deficiency also results in dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system; among other disorders although there is a detailed understanding of the biochemical pathways that are perturbed in cobalamin deficiency the mechanisms underlying agerelated dyshomeostasis in such pathways remain to be addressed because cobalamin utilization is dependent on its efficient transit through lysosomes and mounting evidence indicates that lysosomal function deteriorates in aging longlived postmitotic cells such as neurons in the present article we review published data that supports the proposition that impaired lysosomal processing of cobalamin may play a significant role in agerelated neuro degenerative diseases
although alzheimer's disease criteria promote the use of biomarkers their maturity in clinical routine still needs to be assessed in the light of the oncology framework we conducted a literature review on measures used to assess delayed recall impairment due to medial temporal lobe dysfunction i e free and cued word list recall tests ample evidence is available for phases 1 rationale for use 2 discriminative ability and 3 early detection ability for many of the tests in routine use evidence about phase 4 performance in real world and phase 5 quantify impact and costs is yet to come administration procedures have been standardized and cutoff scores are well validated in large alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impaired series some aspects e g different task formats however hamper the comparability of results among different populations and the reproducibility between laboratories no definite guideline for their use can thus be proposed at the moment accordingly the maturity of such markers is not yet sufficient and requires future investigation to promote the proper use of memory measures in clinical settings c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
we investigated the interaction between approach behaviours measured through performance on a resourcegathering task and selfreported global life stress to predict substance use our hypothesis that high levels of approach behaviour in combination with high life stress would predict elevated substance use was guided by the reinforcement sensitivity theory gray & mcnaughton ninetythree young adult students 61 women and 32 men completed a computerized resourcegathering task and questionnaires assessing global life stress and substance use consistent with the hypothesis approach behaviour was positively related to substance use for individuals with high life stress the findings suggest that person by environment interactions are useful in understanding substance use and we discuss how approachmotivated individuals may arrive at different substance use outcomes as a function of stressful contexts copyright c 2016 john wiley & sons ltd
program of training and social mobilization for living with the semiarid: one million rural cisterns p1mc one of the largest programs of rainwater harvesting for human water supply is underway in brazil this article presents an assessment of the p1mc from the point of view of users the methodology was based on a survey with 623 interviews in 63 municipalities reached by the programme indepth interviews with 32 managers and technicians and 15 users participant and nonparticipant observations and image recording field works were carried out between february 2009 and july 2011 the results indicate that the presence of rainwater harvesting systems reduced by almost 90% the total time spent in search of water results also showed that highly precarious socioeconomic conditions still prevail which is a limiting factor for the achievement of program effectiveness the program has achieved its goal of building physical structures but there are still significant challenges especially those related to adequate supply of water in quantity and quality therefore public policies for water supply in semiarid rural areas should associate technical issues with management elements considering the social climatic and economic local conditions
small satellites have limited payload and their attitudes are sometimes difficult to determine from the limited onboard sensors alone wrong attitudes lead to inaccurate map projections and measurements that require postprocessing correction in this study we propose an automated and robust scheme that derives the satellite attitude from its observation images and known satellite position by matching land features from an observed image and from wellregistered basemap images the scheme combines computer vision algorithms ie feature detection and robust optimization and geometrical constraints of the satellite observation applying the proposed method to uniform1 observations which is a 50 kg class small satellite satellite attitudes were determined with an accuracy of 002 degrees comparable to that of star trackers if the satellite position is accurately determined mapprojected images can be generated based on the accurate attitudes errors in the satellite position can add systematic errors to derived attitudes the proposed scheme focuses on determining satellite attitude with feature detection algorithms applying to raw satellite images unlike image registration studies which register already mapprojected images by delivering accurate attitude determination and map projection the proposed method can improve the image geometries of small satellites and thus reveal finescale information about the earth
honeypots ie networked computer systems specially designed and crafted to mimic the normal operations of other systems while capturing and storing information about the interactions with the world outside are a crucial technology into the study of cyber threats and attacks that propagate and occur through networks among them highinteraction honeypots are considered the most efficient because the attacker whether automated or not perceives realistic interactions with the target machine in the case of automated attacks propagated by malware currently available honeypots alone are not specialized enough to allow the analysis of their behaviors and effects on the target system the research presented in this paper shows how highinteraction honeypots can be enhanced by powering them with specific features that improve the reverse engineering activities needed to effectively analyze captured malicious entities
the clinical progression of new chemical entities to pharmaceuticals remains hindered by the relatively slow pace of technology development in toxicology and clinical safety evaluation particularly in vitro approaches that can be used in the preclinical and early clinical phases of drug development to alleviate this bottleneck we have developed a metabolizing enzyme toxicology assay chip metachip that combines highthroughput p450 catalysis with cellbased screening on a microscale platform the metachip concept is demonstrated by using solgel encapsulated p450s to activate the prodrug cyclophosphamide which is the major constituent of the anticancer drug cytoxan as well as other compounds that are activated by p450 metabolism the metachip provides a highthroughput microscale alternative to currently used in vitro methods for human metabolism and toxicology screening based on liver slices cultured human hepatocytes purified microsomal preparations or isolated and purified p450s this technology creates opportunities for rapid and inexpensive assessment of adme/tox absorption distribution metabolism excretion/toxicology at very early phases of drug development thereby enabling unsuitable candidates to be eliminated from consideration much earlier in the drug discovery process
in this article a numerical method for detailed studies of twophase mass transfer is introduced that is based on a threedimensional finite volume arbitrary lagrangianeulerian method the implementation of the twophase species equation employs the dirichletneumann algorithm following the domain coupling technique of the underlying hydrodynamical solver by tukovic and jasak 2012 the coupling is found to be dependent on the discontinuities of the concentration and its first derivative as well as on which side of the interface dirichlet or neumann conditions are specified relaxation parameters are introduced to stabilize the algorithm and optimal coefficients are calculated explicitly the numerical method is thoroughly validated by a three dimensional advectiondiffusion test case proving the accuracy of the local sherwood numbers for peclet numbers up to 100000 which is ten times higher than the currently reported maximum additionally a limit model for instantaneous reactions is implemented and validated allowing the computation of product concentrations and of local and global enhancement factors c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

adverse conditions during fetal life have been associated to both structural and functional changes in neurodevelopment from the neonatal period to adolescence in this study connectomics was used to assess the evolution of brain networks from infancy to early adolescence brain network reorganization over time in subjects who had suffered adverse perinatal conditions is characterized and related to neurodevelopment and cognition three cohorts of prematurely born infants and children between 28 and 35 weeks of gestational age including individuals with a birth weight appropriated for gestational age and with intrauterine growth restriction iugr were evaluated at 1 6 and 10 years of age respectively a common developmental trajectory of brain networks was identified in both control and iugr groups: network efficiencies of the fractional anisotropy fa weighted and normalized connectomes increase with age which can be related to maturation and myelination of fiber connections while the number of connections decreases which can be associated to an axonal pruning process and reorganization comparing subjects with or without iugr a similar pattern of network differences between groups was observed in the three developmental stages mainly characterized by iugr group having reduced brain network efficiencies in binary and faweighted connectomes and increased efficiencies in the connectome normalized by its total connection strength fa associations between brain networks and neurobehavioral impairments were also evaluated showing a relationship between different network metrics and specific social cognitionrelated scores as well as a higher risk of inattention/hyperactivity and/or executive functional disorders in iugr children
the ability to recognize and adequately interpret emotional states in others plays a fundamental role in regulating social interaction body language presents an essential element of nonverbal communication which is often perceived prior to mimic expression however the neural networks that underlie the processing of emotionally expressive body movement and body posture are poorly understood 33 healthy subjects have been investigated using the optically based imaging method functional nearinfrared spectroscopy fnirs during the performance of a newly developed emotion discrimination paradigm consisting of faceless avatars expressing fearful angry sad happy or neutral gait patterns participants were instructed to judge a the presented emotional state emotion task and b the observed walking speed of the respective avatar speed task we measured increases in cortical oxygenated haemoglobin o2hb in response to visual stimulation during emotion discrimination these o2hb concentration changes were enhanced for negative emotions in contrast to neutral gait sequences in right occipitotemporal and left temporal and temporoparietal brain regions moreover fearful and angry bodies elicited higher activation increases during the emotion task compared to the speed task haemodynamic responses were correlated with a number of behavioural measures whereby a positive relationship between emotion regulation strategy preference and o2hb concentration increases after sad walks was mediated by the ability to accurately categorize sad walks our results support the idea of a distributed brain network involved in the recognition of bodily emotion expression that comprises visual association areas as well as body/movement perception specific cortical regions that are also sensitive to emotion this network is activated less when the emotion is not intentionally processed ie during the speed task furthermore activity of this perceptive network is mediated by the ability to correctly recognize emotions indirectly connected to active emotion regulation processes we conclude that a full understanding of emotion perception and its neural substrate requires the investigation of dynamic representations and means of expression other than the face c 2013 elsevier inc all rights reserved
background: glutaminase 1 is a phosphateactivated metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the first step of glutaminolysis which converts glutamine into glutamate glutamate is the major neurotransmitter of excitatory synapses executing important physiological functions in the central nervous system there are two isoforms of glutaminase 1 kga and gac both of which are generated through alternative splicing from the same gene kga and gac both transcribe 114 exons in the nterminal but each has its unique cterminal in the coding sequence we have previously identified that kga and gac are differentially regulated during inflammatory stimulation and hiv infection furthermore glutaminase 1 has been linked to brain diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis alzheimer's disease and hepatic encephalopathy core enzyme structure of kga and gac has been published recently however how other coding sequences affect their functional enzyme activity remains unclear methods: we cloned and performed serial deletions of human fulllength kga and gac from the nterminal and the cterminal at an interval of approximately 100 amino acids aas prokaryotic expressions of the mutant glutaminase 1 protein and a glutaminase enzyme activity assay were used to determine if kga and gac have similar efficiency and efficacy to convert glutamine into glutamate results: when 110 aas or 218 aas were deleted from the nterminal or when the unique portions of kga and gac that are beyond the 550 aa were deleted from the cterminal kga and gac retained enzyme activity comparable to the full length proteins in contrast deletion of 310 aas or more from nterminal or deletion of 450 aas or more from cterminal resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity for kga/gac consistently when both nand cterminal of the kga and gac were removed creating a truncated protein that expressed the central 219 aa 550 aa the protein retained enzyme activity furthermore expression of the core 219 aa 550 aa coding sequence in cells increased extracellular glutamate concentrations to levels comparable to those of fulllength kga and gac expressions suggesting that the core enzyme activity of the protein lies within the central 219 aa 550 aa fulllength kga and gac retained enzyme activities when kept at 4 degrees c in contrast 219 aa 550 aa truncated protein lost glutaminase activities more readily compared with fulllength kga and gac suggesting that the nterminal and cterminal coding regions are required for the stability kga and gac conclusions: glutaminase isoforms kga and gac have similar efficacy to catalyze the conversion of glutamine to glutamate the core enzyme activity of glutaminase 1 protein is within the central 219 aa 550 aa the nterminal and cterminal coding regions of kga and gac help maintain the longterm activities of the enzymes

visual tracking is a popular research area in computer vision which is very difficult to actualize because of challenges such as changes in scale and illumination rotation fast motion and occlusion consequently the focus in this research area is to make tracking algorithms adapt to these changes so as to implement stable and accurate visual tracking this paper proposes a visual tracking algorithm that integrates the scale invariance of surf feature with deep learning to enhance the tracking robustness when the size of the object to be tracked changes significantly particle filter is used for motion estimation the confidence of each particle is computed via a deep neural network and the result of particle filter is verified and corrected by mean shift because of its computational efficiency and insensitivity to external interference both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging benchmark sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracking algorithm performs favorably against several stateoftheart methods throughout the challenging factors in visual tracking especially for scale variation
space and spatiality had been a thorn in philosophy's side from time immemorial spatiality immediately associated with corporeality finitude even death properly speaking constituted problems for philosophy; enigmas posed to philosophy to disrupt its cool complacency the root of the difficulty it seems rests on nothing more than a prejudice: the rightful domain of philosophy is time understood as pure continuous duration the image of eternity; the compartmentalised units of space are always in the plural the province of cartographers and geographers but certainly not the philosopher lost in his transcendent contemplation what follows then is a preliminary study or better an etude deploying variations on a single theme: how can we liberate space from the cartesian grid under which it has been imprisoned for so long so as to open up its free expanse? what might it be to think of space as a form of duration without breaks without borders without boundaries? and in the last instance is this pure void not another name for the very being of consciousness itself?
hallucinogenic tryptamine analogues an important class of drugs of abuse can be naturally occurring or chemically synthesized compounds in japan psilocin and psilocybin ingredients of magic mushrooms and 5methoxyn ndiisopropyltryptamine 5meodipt; a synthetic tryptamine seem to be particularly problematic due to their extensive abuse this review is focused on human metabolism and forensic toxicological analyses of the above three tryptamine analogues in humans psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated to form psilocin and most of the psilocin is eventually conjugated to form its glucuronide on the other hand 5meodipt is mainly metabolized via odemethylation 6hydroxylation and ndeisopropylation partly followed by conjugation to form their sulfates and glucuronides suitable hydrolysis should be therefore applied for sensitive and effective analysis of the metabolites in analyzing psilocin and psilocybin by gas chromatographymass spectrometry gcms derivatization is necessary for their discriminative identification although 5meodipt and its three major metabolites can be analyzed by gcms without any derivatization trimethylsilyl derivatization provides improvement of their peak shapes and intensities in contrast to gcms liquid chromatographymass spectrometry and liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry allow us not only to discriminate psilocin and psilocybin without derivatization but also to directly analyze their conjugated metabolites

we study the energy dispatch of power distribution networks pdns coupled with urban transportation networks the electricity demand at each charging/swapping facility is influenced by the arrival rates and charging requests of electric vehicles which further depends on the spatial distribution of traffic flows over the entire transportation system we consider the impact of the road congestion on route choices of vehicles from a systemlevel perspective the traffic flow pattern in steady state is characterized by the wardrop user equilibrium we consider the pdn load perturbation caused by the traffic demand uncertainty and propose a robust dispatch method that maintains the feasibility of an alternating current power flow constraints by applying the convex relaxation to nonlinear branch power flow equations the proposed model yields a twostage robust convex optimization problem with an implicit uncertainty set moreover a decomposition framework is proposed in which the first phase determines the uncertainty set of electricity demand by solving two traffic assignment problems associated with the extreme scenarios and the second phase solves a twostage robust secondorder cone program following a delayed constraint generation framework several issues regarding the scalability and conservatism are elaborated case studies corroborate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method
in recent years parallel computing has been widely employed for both science research and commercial applications for parallel systems such as manycore or computer clusters it is inevitable to have one or more computing node failures due to random errors or injected attacks usually a diagnosis mechanism is able to locate several defective nodes through a number of tests and the analysis of those test signatures syndromes although this covers the cases caused by random errors sophisticated attacks are still able to manipulate the outputs of each node so that they will be masked and pass the diagnosis therefore in this paper we propose a hybrid selfdiagnosis mechanism we adopt a new type of analysis with the linear syndromes which are able to locate up to a certain number of defective nodes caused by random errors in addition to this we introduce a new type of robust analysis of the nonlinear syndromes which is capable of detecting the attacks undetectable by the linear syndromes at a probability close to one moreover since this hybrid selfdiagnosis mechanism is on the data level which makes little distinction among different operating systems and programming languages it can be migrated onto any other platforms conveniently
patient: a 69yearold japanese male visited nihon university dental hospital for refabrication of his mandibular implantsupported complete fixed prosthesis iscfpd and maxillary complete denture which had been fabricated 15 years previously in this case cetzp/al2o3 nanocomposite cetzp/a was applied to the framework of the mandibular iscfpd and maxillary complete denture three years after deliver of the framework no particularly notable biological or prosthetic complications were observed and a high level of patient satisfaction had been achieved discussion: conventional iscfpd frameworks were fabricated by casting gold alloys; however with the recent advancement of cad/cam technology titanium ti or yttria tetragonal zirconia polycrystal ytzp frameworks have become more common in contrast the main fabrication method for ti or cocr frameworks of removable dental prostheses has shifted from the conventional casting method to cad/cam fabrication cetzp/a which was chosen as the framework material this time shows higher strength and greater toughness than ytzp however since it has a low lighttransmitting property and exhibits an opaque white color the range of its application in fixed prostheses particularly in the esthetic area is limited conclusion: we described a case in which cetzp/a was applied to the frameworks of a mandibular iscfpd and a maxillary complete denture no particularly notable biological or prosthetic complications were observed in the mandibular iscfpd or the maxillary complete denture and a high level of patient satisfaction was achieved medium and longterm observations with a greater number of cases are essential to obtain information concerning various phenomena related to this procedure c 2016 japan prosthodontic society published by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
prior research shows that people feel authentic when they express themselves in this research we examined how people from different cultures make inferences about a target person's authenticity based on information about that person's selfexpression our culturalfit hypothesis proposes that acts of selfexpression enhance perceptions of authenticity when they are congruent with the culturally prevalent selfexpression norms in an experiment with germans and chinese reading scenarios and making inferences about a hypothetical person we found that authenticity judgments were the highest when the target person's selfexpression matched the culturally valued selfexpression stylethat is expressing both likes and dislikes in germany and expressing only likes but no dislikes in china moreover we found that the interactive effect of selfexpression and culture had downstream effects on information processing such that in the case of countercultural selfexpression practices participants were more likely to seek information that would compensate for this cultural incongruence
although intelligence should theoretically evolve to help animals solve specific types of problems posed by the environment it is unclear which environmental challenges favour enhanced cognition or how general intelligence evolves along with domainspecific cognitive abilities the social intelligence hypothesis posits that big brains and great intelligence have evolved to cope with the labile behaviour of group mates we have exploited the remarkable convergence in social complexity between cercopithecine primates and spotted hyaenas to test predictions of the social intelligence hypothesis in regard to both cognition and brain size behavioural data indicate that there has been considerable convergence between primates and hyaenas with respect to their social cognitive abilities moreover compared with other hyaena species spotted hyaenas have larger brains and expanded frontal cortex as predicted by the social intelligence hypothesis however broader comparative study suggests that domaingeneral intelligence in carnivores probably did not evolve in response to selection pressures imposed specifically in the social domain the cognitive buffer hypothesis which suggests that general intelligence evolves to help animals cope with novel or changing environments appears to offer a more robust explanation for general intelligence in carnivores than any hypothesis invoking selection pressures imposed strictly by sociality or foraging demands

discontinuous galerkin dg methods allow highorder flow solutions on unstructured or locally refined meshes by increasing the polynomial degree and using curved instead of straightsided elements however one of the currently largest obstacles to applying these methods to aerodynamic configurations of medium to high complexity is the availability of appropriate higherorder curved meshes in this article we describe a complete chain of higherorder unstructured grid generation and higherorder dg flow solution applied to a turbulent flow around a threedimensional highlift configuration this includes i the generation of an appropriately coarse straightsided mesh; ii the evaluation of additional points on the computeraided design geometry of the curvedwall boundary for defining a piecewise polynomial boundary representation; iii a higher order mesh deformation to translate the curvature from the wall boundary into the interior of the computational domain; and iv the description of a dg discretization which is sufficiently stable to allow a flow computation on the resulting curved mesh finally a fourthorder flow solution of the reynoldsaveraged navierstokes and k! turbulence model equations is computed on a fourthorder unstructured hybrid mesh around the threedimensional highlift simulation of wingflow noise generation configuration copyright c 2016 john wiley & sons ltd

the optimal stenting technique for coronary artery bifurcations is still debated with additional advances computational simulations can soon be used to compare stent designs or strategies based on verified structural and hemodynamics results in order to identify the optimal solution for each individual's anatomy in this study patientspecific simulations of stent deployment were performed for 2 cases to replicate the complete procedure conducted by interventional cardiologists subsequent computational fluid dynamics cfd analyses were conducted to quantify hemodynamic quantities linked to restenosis patientspecific preoperative models of coronary bifurcations were reconstructed from ct angiography and optical coherence tomography oct plaque location and composition were estimated from oct and assigned to models and structural simulations were performed in abaqus artery geometries after virtual stent expansion of xience prime or nobori stents created in solidworks were compared to postoperative geometry from oct and ct before being extracted and used for cfd simulations in simvascular inflow boundary conditions based on body surface area and downstream vascular resistances and capacitances were applied at branches to mimic physiology artery geometries obtained after virtual expansion were in good agreement with those reconstructed from patient images quantitative comparison of the distance between reconstructed and poststent geometries revealed a maximum difference in area of 204% adverse indices of wall shear stress were more pronounced for thicker nobori stents in both patients these findings verify structural analyses of stent expansion introduce a workflow to combine software packages for solid and fluid mechanics analysis and underscore important stent design features from prior idealized studies the proposed approach may ultimately be useful in determining an optimal choice of stent and position for each patient c 2015 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
previous studies have noted that narcissists do in some cases experience benefits the current study adds to this discussion by examining whether age might moderate the links between narcissism and a selfreported benefit life satisfaction and an observerreported benefit observer ratings of personality in a sample of college students and their family members n 807 the authors demonstrate that narcissism positively correlates with life satisfaction for adolescents and emerging adults but not for adult participants in addition the relationship between narcissism and observerreported neuroticism was weakly negative for undergraduate students but significant and positive for their mothers taken together these results suggest that narcissism is more beneficial for adolescents and emerging adults than for adults both sets of analyses also pointed to the importance of studying narcissism as a multifaceted construct findings are discussed with respect to personality development theories that emphasize adult role adoption

harvested rainwater is an alternative water source for buildings especially for nonpotable uses such as irrigation and toilet flushing while rainwater harvesting is perceived as a sustainable design approach there is limited information on the environmental and economic performance of this technology to address this literature gap life cycle assessment and life cycle costing tools were applied for a dormitory that could potentially use harvested rainwater to flush toilets or to irrigate the lawn five scenarios were modeled including a new versus renovated building and irrigation versus toilet flushing water end use the rainwater cisterns for all the scenarios were sized using the yield after spillage approach and long term daily precipitation of toledo energy and greenhouse gas emissions were calculated using economic input output life cycle assessment for construction phase and energy use by pump and gabi for water and wastewater treatment databases the life cycle environmental impacts and costs were estimated and compared to the business as usual scenario where the water supply demands are met by municipally supplied potable water in a combined or separate sanitary sewer network it was discovered that energy and greenhouse gas emission payback periods can be achieved for almost every scenario yet cost payback periods of implementing harvested rainwater were found to be longer than the life time of the building except for two scenarios: using rainwater for irrigation in a renovation project and using rainwater for toilet flushing in a new construction project these two scenarios had the lowest cost energy and greenhouse gas emission impacts among all scenarios modeled reducing occupancy to match toilet flushing demand increased the per person impact however in general the per person impacts were much lower than a person's impact from driving or electricity use while separate sewers divert the stormwater runoff to the water bodies and thereby prevent the environmental problems resulting from combined sewer overflows a rainwater harvesting system connected to separate sewers was found to reduce the energy and greenhouse gas emissions less than so if the rainwater harvesting system were connected to combined sewers c 2015 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the critical involvement of reactive oxygen species ros in both physiological and pathological processes in cell biology makes their detection and assessment a fundamental topic in biomedical research established methodologies to study ros in cell biology take advantage of oxidation reactions between the ros and a reduced probe after reacting the probe reveals the presence of ros either by the appearance of colour chromogenic reaction or fluorescence fluorogenic reaction however current methodologies rarely allow for a sitespecific detection of ros production here we propose a colorimetric reaction driven by the oxidation of 3 3'diaminobenzidine dab by photodynamicallyproduced ros that allows for fine detection of the ros production site the introduced methodology is fast easy to implement and permits cellular resolution at the submicrometric level although the basic protocol is proved in a photodynamic model of ros generation the principle is applicable to many different scenarios of intracellular ros production as a consequence this proposed methodology should greatly complement other techniques aiming at establishing a precise subcellular localization of ros generation c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
as a next generation networking protocol openflow enhances network performance by separating the control plane from data plane it can be implemented for quality of service: users desiring network resources or with higher priorities defined by the system are allocated with adequate resources besides the communication protocol another two elements are required to complete the openflowsystem: the switch either physical or virtual which supports openflow and the controller which sends setting packets to control the switch flow table with openflow users are not restricted to functions provided by the specific switch since by a standard application programming interface api users can define wanted functions instead of predefined ones bundled in operating systems this paper aims to create an openflow switch monitoring system which oversees traffic pass through switches under the controller and provides a convenient webpage for network administrators to modify flow priorities and effectively manage the network

the twodimensional 2d incompressible boussinesq equations model geophysical fluids and play an important role in the study of the raleigh bernard convection mathematically this 2d system retains some key features of the 3d navierstokes and euler equations such as the vortex stretching mechanism the issue of whether the 2d boussinesq equations always possess global in time classical solutions can be difficult when there is only partial dissipation or no dissipation at all this paper obtains the global regularity for two partial dissipation cases and proves several global a priori bounds for two other prominent partial dissipation cases these results take us one step closer to a complete resolution of the global regularity issue for all the partial dissipation cases involving the 2d boussinesq equations c 2015 elsevier inc all rights reserved
according to consciousness involvement human's learning can be roughly classified into explicit learning and implicit learning contrasting strongly to explicit learning with clear targets and rules such as our school study of mathematics learning is implicit when we acquire new information without intending to do so research from psychology indicates that implicit learning is ubiquitous in our daily life moreover implicit learning plays an important role in human visual perception but in the past 60 years most of the wellknown machinelearning models aimed to simulate explicit learning while the work of modeling implicit learning was relatively limited especially for computer vision applications this article proposes a novel unsupervised computational model for implicit visual learning by exploring dissipative system which provides a unifying macroscopic theory to connect biology with physics we test the proposed dissipative implicit learning model dilm on various datasets the experiments show that dilm not only provides a good match to human behavior but also improves the explicit machinelearning performance obviously on image classification tasks
for over 50 years a debate has existed over the use of native american sports mascots; however few empirical studies on the topic exist the present study examined if supraliminal exposure to native american mascots results in the application of negative stereotypes toward native american people results indicated that the effect of native american mascots was moderated by people's racial attitudes toward native people when exposed to native mascots people with a prejudiced attitude rated a native american individual more stereotypically aggressive than those with a nonprejudiced attitude however this pattern did not occur when people were exposed to white mascots or neutral images furthermore this pattern was not evident when people evaluated a nonnative individual this overall pattern of results indicates that native american mascots selectively facilitate the application of negative stereotypes resulting in harmful evaluations of native american people

the goal of the present paper was to investigate whether soccer referees' nonverbal behavior nvb differed based on the difficulty of their decisions and whether perceivers could detect these systematic variations on the one hand communicating confidence via nvb is emphasized in referee training on the other hand it seems feasible from a theoretical point of view that particularly following relatively difficult decisions referees have problems controlling their nvb we conducted three experiments to investigate this question experiment 1 n 40 and experiment 2 n 60 provided evidence that perceivers regard referees' nvb as less confident following ambiguous decisions as compared with following unambiguous decisions experiment 3 n 58 suggested that perceivers were more likely to debate with the referee when referees nonverbally communicated less confidence we discuss consequences for referee training
urban streams could concurrently bring about both positive amenities accruing to the view of waterscape and negative disamenities associated with water pollution in this paper we focus on a specific question that has not yet been explicitly answered in the extant literature: howto estimate the cumulative impacts of urban streams which refer to the combined impacts of amenities and disamenities of multiple sources in high density and highrise urban contexts a typical residential apartment complex comprised of a number of apartment units located in dozens of mid to highrise commercial apartment buildings on a contiguous land parcel in guangzhou south china is used as a case study a detailed palette of natural amenities and environmental disamenities of two bifurcated streams are quantified via the generalized spatial twostage least squares gs2sls model in this model an originally constructed 3d spatial connectivity matrix cube contiguity is applied to address in a sophisticated manner an array of endogenous exogenous and error interactions along both horizontal and vertical dimensions that inherently exist in the spatial context of highrise housing markets our results from spatial hedonic models at the microneighborhood level demonstrate that homebuyers tend to evaluate urban streams' chemical physical and ecological features holistically a cumulative impact is also found as homebuyers would like to pay an extra premium for an apartment located farther away from both polluted streams this study advances the extant literature by contributing to a novel and effective extension of the conventional twodimensional spatial matrix which can capture the longignored spatial correlation existing amongst apartment units located on contiguous floors as well as a robust estimation of the demand of urban natural and environmental amenities in the gradually rising mid and highrise housing market in both developing and developed countries
this paper proposes a new highlevel approach for optimising field programmable gate array fpga designs fpga designs are commonly implemented in lowlevel hardware description languages hdls which lack the abstractions necessary for identifying opportunities for significant performance improvements using a computer vision case study we show that modelling computation with dataflow abstractions enables substantial restructuring of fpga designs before lowering to the hdl level and also improve cpu performance using the cpu transformations runtime is reduced by 43 % using the fpga transformations clock frequency is increased from 67mhz to 110mhz our results outperform commercial lowlevel hdl optimisations showcasing dataflow program abstraction as an amenable computation model for highly effective fpga optimisation
tropical herbivorous insects are astonishingly diverse and many are highly hostspecific much evidence suggests that herbivorous insect diversity is a function of host plant diversity; yet the diversity of some lineages exceeds the diversity of plants although most species of herbivorous fruit flies in the neotropical genus blepharoneura are strongly hostspecific they deposit their eggs in a single host plant species and flower sex some species are collected from multiple hosts or flowers and these may represent examples of lineages that are diversifying via changes in host use here we investigate patterns of diversification within six geographically widespread blepharoneura species that have been collected and reared from at least two host plant species or host plant parts we use microsatellites to 1 test for evidence of local genetic differentiation associated with different sympatric hosts different plant species or flower sexes and 2 examine geographic patterns of genetic differentiation across multiple south american collection sites in four of the six fly species we find evidence of local genetic differences between flies collected from different hosts all six species show evidence of geographic structure with consistent differences between flies collected in the guiana shield and flies collected in amazonia continentwide analyses reveal in all but one instance that genetically differentiated flies collected in sympatry from different host species or different sex flowers are not one another's closest relatives indicating that genetic differences often arise in allopatry before or at least coincident with the evolution of novel host use
a prerequisite for reliable hydraulic measurements is an accurate collection of the plant material thereby the native hydraulic state of the sample has to be preserved during harvesting ie cutting the plant or plant parts and preparation ie excising the target section this is particularly difficult when harvesting has to be done under transpiring conditions in this article we present a harvesting and sampling protocol designed for hydraulic measurements on malus domestica borkh and checked for possible sampling artefacts to test for artefacts we analysed the percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity maximum specific conductivity and water contents of bark and wood of branches taking into account conduit length time of day of harvesting different shoot ages and seasonal effects our results prove that use of appropriate protocols can avoid artefactual embolization or refilling even when the xylem is under tension at harvest the presented protocol was developed for malus but may also be applied for other angiosperms with similar anatomy and refilling characteristics
nutrition plays an important role in human metabolism and health metabolomics is a promising tool for clinical genetic and nutritional studies a key question is to what extent metabolomic profiles reflect nutritional patterns in an epidemiological setting we assessed the relationship between metabolomic profiles and nutritional intake in women from a large crosssectional community study food frequency questionnaires ffqs were applied to 1 003 women from the twinsuk cohort with targeted metabolomic analyses of serum samples using the biocrates absoluteidq tm kit p150 163 metabolites we analyzed seven nutritional parameters: coffee intake garlic intake and nutritional scores derived from the ffqs summarizing fruit and vegetable intake alcohol intake meat intake hypocaloric dieting and a traditional english diet we studied the correlation between metabolite levels and dietary intake patterns in the larger population and identified for each trait between 14 and 20 independent monozygotic twins pairs discordant for nutritional intake and replicated results in this set results from both analyses were then metaanalyzed for the metabolites associated with nutritional patterns we calculated heritability using structural equation modelling 42 metabolite nutrient intake associations were statistically significant in the discovery samples bonferroni p < 4 x 10 5 and 11 metabolite nutrient intake associations remained significant after validation we found the strongest associations for fruit and vegetables intake and a glycerophospholipid phosphatidylcholine diacyl c38:6 p 139 x 10 9 and a sphingolipid sphingomyeline c26:1 p 695 x 10 13 we also found significant associations for coffee confirming a previous association with c10 reported in an independent study garlic intake and hypocaloric dieting using the twin study design we find that two thirds the metabolites associated with nutritional patterns have a significant genetic contribution and the remaining third are solely environmentally determined our data confirm the value of metabolomic studies for nutritional epidemiologic research
negative attitudes are a major barrier to the equality of people with disabilities governments and other organizations have implemented numerous programmes to change attitudes towards people with disabilities we analyse published evidence about the effectiveness of such programmes using a framework of the interrelationship among three levels of policy intervention to change attitudes: personal level directed at changing the attitudes of individuals; organizational level concerning attitudinal barriers in domains such as employment education and health; and government level legally mandating behaviour change the analysis finds that the following policy types can be effective if used together: policies that involve direct contact with people with disability; information and awareness campaigns; education and training about disability; and antidiscrimination enforcement policy characteristics that contribute to effectiveness include a positive programme experience for participants; multifaceted and prolonged interventions; and adequate programme resources policy effectiveness to change attitudes relies on corresponding reinforcement at all three policy levels
water resources play an important role in demographic social and economic development the present study divides the macroeconomic factors that affect the sustainable use of water resources into five major subsystems: economy population water supply and demand land resources and water pollution and management it then constructs a feedback loop and stockflow chart of the systems with the system dynamics model to simulate water supply and demand conditions and future changes in the gap between supply and demand from 2005 to 2020 further this study designs different development programs to simulate the changes to the key variables by changing the value of important model parameters it is found that a balanced development program can achieve not only steady economic growth provide a demographic dividend and protect arable land resources but also maximize the sewage treatment rate and improve the reutilization efficiency of water moreover we find that the fundamental way in which to bridge the gap between the supply and demand of water resources is to improve water supply rather than control demand c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the optimal management of chronic hepatitis b virus hbv infections is known to be related with the genotype of hbv in order to prescribe the most appropriate treatment in this study including 19 chronic hbv patients from st parascheva clinical infectious disease hospital ia degrees i we attempted to double test their samples for dna/hbv detection and genotyping dna/hbv evidenced from19 patients known as being chronic infected by hbv were tested by two molecular techniques: real time pcr polymerase chain reaction and genotyping by hybridization on strips we obtained identical results from both methods the most frequent genotype was d 474% followed by genotype a 10 5% ; 9 samples were negative probably because of virus suppressed replication under treatment the double testing is accurate time and cost efficient and for these reasons we propose this double testing like a possible algorithm for routine diagnostic being timeefficient and accurate for hbv chronic infected patients' management cases

this paper proposes a novel dcside discretetime voltage controller for gridconnected voltagesourced converters during asymmetrical faults the main objective is to eliminate the secondorder voltage oscillation on the vsc's dcside as well as the positive sequence thirdorder harmonic current injection into the grid during asymmetrical faults the compensator is designed based on the comprehensive discretetime model of the dcside dynamics it is shown that dcside average voltage can be controlled by the positive sequence direct axis current while the oscillating component can be fully controlled by negative sequence dqaxes currents the negative sequence current references are obtained using a discrete resonant controller plus a lead filter in order to achieve zero steady state error and asymptotically stability without injecting harmonics currents into the grid simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under severe fault conditions c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
industrial waste heat may be one of the answers to future energy demands depending on the temperature industrial waste heat may be used to produce electricity or meet cooling or heating demands at different temperature levels however in order to estimate the influence the waste heat may have in future energy systems the magnitude of the industrial waste heat in the different countries need to be estimated for germany so far only topdown analyses of the waste heat potential exist using key figures derived from other studies in other countries in this paper the first bottomup approach for estimating the industrial waste heat potential in germany is presented for this approach an algorithm to evaluate and test the mandatory emission report data from german production companies was developed in a second step round about 81 000 data sets have been evaluated to calculate a conservative and lower boundary value for the industrial waste heat as this conservative lower boundary based on the collected data from the german industry the waste heat volume was evaluated as 127 pj/a or 13 % of the industrial fuel consumption results were used to derive key figures with which the missing share of the data was approximated
we sought to validate and extend the findings of a 282 psoriatic arthritis patient cohort from dublin using a 219 patient cohort from bath the central finding of this study was that several structurally unrelated hla alleles including b*08:01:01 b*18:01:01 b*27:05:02 b*55:01:01 and c*06:02:01 were found to be significantly associated with particular phenotypic features of psoriatic arthritis implying that the clinical diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis designates a genetically heterogeneous subset of individuals radiographic sacroiliitis was associated with either b*08:01:01 or b*27:05:02 with implications about the role of mhc molecules in an adaptive immune response there are also implications for psoriatic arthritis diagnostic criteria since some disease features used in the criteria are under genetic control these findings have important implications for understanding the role of mhc alleles in directing the adaptive immune response to mediate the inflammation responsible for psoriatic arthritis c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved

camera objectives or laser focusing units consist of complex lens systems with multiple lenses the optical performance of such complex lens systems is dependent on the correct positioning of lenses in the system deviations in location or angle within the system directly affect the achievable image quality to optimize the achievable performance of lens systems these errors can be corrected by machining the mount of the lens with respect to the optical axis the innolite gmbh and opto alignment technology have developed a novel machine for such center turning operation a confocal laser reflection measurement sensor determines the absolute position of the optical axis with reference to the spindle axis as a strong advantage compared to autocollimator measurements the utilized opto alignment sensor is capable of performing centration and tilt measurements without changing objectives on any radius surface from 2 mm to infinity and lens diameters from 05 mm to 300 mm including cylinder aspheric and parabolic surfaces in addition it performs significantly better on coated lenses the optical axis is skewed and offset in reference to the spindle axis as determined by the measurement using the information about the mount and all reference surfaces a machine program for an untrue turning process is calculated from this data in a fully automated manner since the optical axis is not collinear with the spindle axis the diamond tool compensates for these linear and tilt deviations with small correction movements this results in a simple machine setup where the control system works as an electronic alignment chuck remaining eccentricity of <1 mu m and angular errors of < 10 sec are typical alignment results
mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathological mechanism of alzheimer's disease ad amyloid betaprotein a beta which plays a central role in ad pathogenesis is reported to accumulate within mitochondria however a question remains as to whether a beta is generated locally from amyloid precursor protein app within mitochondria we investigated this issue by analyzing the expression patterns of app appprocessing secretases and app metabolites in mitochondria separated from human neuroblastoma shsy5y cells and those expressing swedish mutant apr app bace1 and pen2 protein levels were significantly lower in crude mitochondria than microsome fractions while those of adam10 and the other gammasecretase complex components presenilin 1 nicastrin and aph1 were comparable between fractions the crude mitochondrial fraction containing substantial levels of cathepsin d a lysosomal marker was further separated via iodixanol gradient centrifugation to obtain mitochondria and lysosomeenriched fractions mature app bace1 and all gammasecretase complex components in particular presenilin 1 and pen 2 were scarcely present in the mitochondriaenriched fraction compared to the lysosomeenriched fraction moreover expression of the betacterminal fragment betactf of app was markedly low in the mitochondriaenriched fraction additionally immunocytochemical analysis showed very little colocalization between presenilin 1 and tom20 a marker protein of mitochondria in view of the particularly low expression levels of bace1 gammasecretase complex proteins and betactf in mitochondria we propose that it is unlikely that a beta generation from app occurs locally within this organelle c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved

in germany high prevalence rates for problematic alcohol use and problematic internet use in adolescents were reported the objective of the present study was to identify psychopathological factors associated with these two behavior patterns to our knowledge this is the first investigation assessing psychopathological factors for both problematic alcohol and problematic internet use in the same sample of adolescents we surveyed a sample of 1444 adolescents in germany regarding problematic alcohol use problematic internet use psychopathology and psychological wellbeing we conducted binary logistic regression analyses 56% of the sample showed problematic alcohol use 48% problematic internet use and 08% both problematic alcohol and problematic internet use problematic alcohol use was higher in adolescents with problematic internet use compared to those without problematic internet use conduct problems and depressive symptoms were statistically significant associated with both problematic alcohol and problematic internet use prosocial behavior was related to problematic internet use male gender and less peer problems were associated with problematic alcohol use for the first time associations between adolescent problematic alcohol and problematic internet use due to common psychopathological factors were identified however in addition to shared factors we found also specific psychopathological correlates associated with these two behavior patterns c 2016 elsevier ireland ltd all rights reserved
design for manufacturing dfm is a highly integral methodology in product development starting from the concept development phase with the aim of improving manufacturing productivity and maintaining product quality while design for assembly dfa is focusing on elimination or combination of parts with other components boothroyd dewhurst and knight 2002 which in most cases relates to performing a function and manufacture operation in a simpler way dfm is following a more holistic approach during dfm the considerable background work required for the conceptual phase is compensated for by a shortening of later development phases current dfm projects normally apply an iterative stepbystep approach and eventually transfer to the developer team although dfm has been a well established methodology for about 30 years a fraunhofer iao study from 2009 found that dfm was still one of the key challenges of the german manufacturing industry a new knowledge based approach to dfm eliminating steps of dfm was introduced in paul and aldirini 2009 the concept focuses on a concurrent engineering process between the manufacturing engineering and product development systems while current product realization cycles depend on a rigorous backandforth examineandcorrect approach so as to ensure compatibility of any proposed design to the dfm rules and guidelines adopted by the company the key to achieving reductions is to incorporate dfm considerations into the early stages of the design process a case study for dfm application in an automotive powertrain engineering environment is presented it is argued that a dfm database needs to be interfaced to the cad/cam software which will restrict designers to the dfm criteria consequently a notable reduction of development cycles can be achieved the case study is following the hypothesis that current dfm methods do not improve product design in a manner claimed by the dfm method the critical case was to identify dfa/dfm recommendations or program actions with repeated appearance in different sources repetitive dfm measures are identified analyzed and it is shown how a modified dfm process can mitigate a nonfully integrated dfm approach
mesalazine undergoes extensive metabolism by nacetylation while there is some evidence for an involvement of nacetyltransferase nat type 1 a potential role of nat type 2 nat2 in vivo has not been tested in two studies in healthy young caucasians nat2 phenotyping was carried out using a caffeine metabolic ratio in urine 46 h postdose in study a 1 000 mg mesalazine doses were given thrice daily for 5 days and urine and blood samples were drawn during the last dosing interval in study b a 1 000 mg single dose was given and samples were taken for 48 h postdose pharmacokinetics of mesalazine and nacetylmesalazine lcms/ms were calculated by noncompartmental methods nat2 phenotype could be allocated unequivocally in 21 slow and 5 rapid acetylators in study a and in 9 slow and 8 rapid acetylators in study b geometric mean cv% values in study a for slow rapid acetylators were as follows: mesalazine auc 111 a mu g/ml center dot h 51% 120 a mu g/ml center dot h 52% nacetylmesalazine auc 277 a mu g/ml center dot h 32% 305 a mu g/ml center dot h 27% mesalazine ae 853% 89% 903% 52% nacetylmesalazine ae 314% 46% 322 41% values in study b were as follows: mesalazine auc 345 a mu g/ml center dot h 113% 236 a mu g/ml center dot h 87% nacetylmesalazine auc 213 a mu g/ml center dot h 29% 180 a mu g/ml center dot h 39% mesalazine ae 02% 256% 01% 359% nacetylmesalazine ae 309% 44% 181% 84% higher auc and ae values for mesalazine in steady state study indicate saturation of mesalazine metabolism statistics provided no evidence for a true difference in mesalazine pharmacokinetics between slow and rapid acetylators and no significant correlation between nat2 activity and any mesalazine pharmacokinetic parameter was found nat2 has no major role in human metabolism of mesalazine in vivo
the current study aims to evaluate the capabilities of soil water balance modeling to estimate et for very different conditions of rainfed grapevine water status within a vineyard landscape that depicts heterogeneities in canopy soil and water table conditions we calibrated the hydrus1d model against measurements of the soil moisture profile within seven contrasted sites we validated hydrus1d simulations against et estimates derived from eddy covariance ec measurements within two contrasted sites and we analyzed the temporal dynamics of the hydrus1d et simulations throughout almost two growth cycles for the seven sites the calibration of hydrus1d was correctly achieved with a relative rmse of 20% on average validation of hydrus1d simulations against ec measurements was satisfactory with rmse values of about 40w m 2 at the hourly timescale and 05 mm d 1 at the daily timescale hydrus1d was able to provide consistent time series of et within the seven contrasted sites and throughout the two growth cycles we conclude that hydrus1d simulations can be used as an alternative to ec measurements within rainfed vineyards to alleviate experimental efforts for device cost and maintenance further hydrus1d simulations can be used for characterizing spatial variabilities and temporal dynamics assessing impact of pedological conditions and land use on et or validating remote sensing retrievals over regional extents c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved
the remote sensing image data is so vast that it requires compression by lowcomplexity algorithm on spaceborne equipment binary tree coding with adaptive scanning order btca is an effective algorithm for the mission however for largescale remote sensing images btca requires a lot of memory and does not provide random access property in this paper we propose a new coding method based on btca and optimize truncation the wavelet image is first divided into several blocks which are encoded individually by btca according the property of btca we select the valid truncation points for each block carefully to optimize the ratio of ratedistortion so that a higher compression ratio lower memory requirement and random access property are attained without any entropy coding the proposed method is simple and fast which is very suitable for spaceborne equipment experiments are conducted on three remote sensing image sets and the results show that it can significantly improve psnr ssim and vif as well as subjective visual experience c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved
previous research suggests that the established link of vertical position and selfassignment of social power affects the processing of social exclusion we hypothesized that verticalityinduced selfassignment of social power moderates the evaluation of exclusion via a change in subjective expectancy of social participation following this idea a superior positionassociated with higher powerwas supposed to increase the sensitivity for a transition to social exclusion the transition was simulated in a virtual ball tossing game cyberball : an inclusionary block was followed by partial exclusion of the participant the participants' vertical position relative to the coplayers was varied in three experimental groups superior vs even vs inferior from inclusion to partial exclusion we observed an increase of an eventrelated brain potential related to the violation of subjective expectancy p3 and participants reported a corresponding increase in threat to social needs and negative mood for participants at inferior position exclusionary effects on both p3 and need threat were less pronounced as compared to participants at even or superior position these results indicate that verticality impacts basic cognitive processes of subjective expectancy formation an inferior position already provides a bias for the loss of social power and the transition to social exclusion is less unexpected
this paper presents a novel realworld application for energy savings in a smart building environment the proposed system unifies heterogeneous wireless sensor networks under a semantic web service middleware two complementary and mutually exclusive rulebased approaches for enforcing energysaving policies are proposed: a reactive agent based on production rules and a deliberative agent based on defeasible logic the system was deployed at a greek university showing promising experimental results at least 4% daily savings although the percentage of energy savings may seem low the greatest merit of the method is ensuring that no energy is wasted by constantly enforcing the policies c 2014 elsevier bv all rights reserved

this paper deals with the motion analysis of skier gliding on the actual snow field using inertial sensors it is difficult to measure the motion of skier gliding on the actual snow field since the gliding velocity is fast and the measurement area is large therefore few studies have analyzed ski turns in gliding on the actual snow field it is necessary to analyze the skier gliding on the actual snow field in resolving the mechanism of ski turns in our previous study we developed the motion measurement method of skier using inertial and magnetic field sensors the 3d posture is estimated by applying the sensor fusion method and the method can estimate the 3d posture compensating the drift error of gyro sensor and reducing the effect of dynamic acceleration of accelerometer furthermore we developed the sensor fusion method estimating the 3d posture in local coordinate by the information of inertial sensors attaching the body segments the joint angle of skier in gliding on the actual snow field can be estimated by this method and inverse kinematics we conducted the measurement experiment by skier gliding on the actual snow field the inertial sensors and the gps receiver were attached to the body segments and the top of skier respectively skier conducted carving and skidding turns in this experiment we calculated the joint angles of skier by the information of inertial sensors and the switchovers of turns are estimated by the gps receiver output the results of motion analysis indicated the major feature of skier's motion and the difference between carving and skidding turns therefore the analysis results can be used to the skill rating the clarification of the mechanism of ski turns and the suggestion of more ideal turning form c 2013 the authors published by elsevier ltd selection and peerreview under responsibility of the school of aerospace mechanical and manufacturing engineering rmit university
amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles nfts in the brain are the neuropathological hallmarks of alzheimer's disease ad amyloid plaques are composed of betaamyloid peptides a beta while nfts contain hyperphosphorylated tau proteins patients with familial ad who have mutations in the amyloid precursor protein app gene have either increased production of a beta or generate more aggregationprone forms of a beta the findings of familial ad mutations in the app gene suggest that a beta plays a central role in the pathophysiology of ad a beta 42 composed of 42 amino acid residues aggregates readily and is considered to form amyloid plaque however the processes of plaque formation are still not well known it is generally thought that a beta is secreted into the extracellular space and aggregates to form amyloid plaques a beta as extracellular aggregates and amyloid plaques are thought to be toxic to the surrounding neurons the intraneuronal accumulation of a beta has more recently been demonstrated and is reported to be involved in synaptic dysfunction cognitive impairment and the formation of amyloid plaques in ad we herein provide an overview of the process of the intraneuronal accumulation of a beta and plaque formation and discuss its implications for the pathology early diagnosis and therapy of ad
background: the multisite prescription opioid addiction treatment study poats conducted by the national drug abuse treatment clinical trials network was the largest clinical trial yet conducted with patients dependent upon prescription opioids n 653 in addition to main trial results the study yielded numerous secondary analyses and included a 35year followup study the first of its kind with this population this paper reviews key findings from poats and its followup study methods: the paper summarizes the poats design main outcomes predictors of outcome subgroup analyses the predictive power of early treatment response and the longterm followup study results: poats examined combinations of buprenorphinenaloxone of varying duration and counseling of varying intensity the primary outcome analysis showed no overall benefit to adding drug counseling to buprenorphinenaloxone and weekly medical management only 7% of patients achieved a successful outcome abstinence or nearabstinence from opioids during a 4week taper and 8week followup; by comparison 49% of patients achieved success while subsequently stabilized on buprenorphinenaloxone longterm followup results were more encouraging with higher abstinence rates than in the main trial patients receiving opioid agonist treatment at the time of followup were more likely to have better outcomes though a sizeable number of patients succeeded without agonist treatment some patients initiated risky use patterns including heroin use and drug injection a limitation of the longterm followup study was the low followup rate conclusions: poats was the first largescale study of the treatment of prescription opioid dependence; its findings can influence both treatment guidelines and future studies c 2017 the author s published by elsevier ireland ltd

this paper investigates feasibility of developing a predictive rating method to optimize line rating of underground transmission lines based on weather forecast information transmission lines overhead or underground are essential and indispensable parts of the electric grid which basically transfer energy from the production point to where it is needed line rating defined as line's maximum capacity to transfer electric current and power safely and reliably under certain constraints and criteria to ensure safe operation rating has been classically calculated according to the worst case scenario where conductor's temperature rise would remain within specified limit under most unfavorable conditions obviously such an approach leads to very conservative results leaving line mostly underutilized throughout its life span in order to optimize line utilization ambient adjusted rating and more recently dynamic line rating methods are developed for instance in dynamic line rating realtime data are used to determine instantaneous line rating we have investigated necessity and possibility of developing a predictive model for underground transmission lines by employing weather forecast information which would enable line operators or owners to anticipate optimized line ampacity and maximum rating over the next few days the proposed basic model builds upon the already developed and welldocumented analogy between thermal and electrical circuits yet incorporates a time varying source to account for constantly changing ambient temperature deterministic weather forecast information can be collected from environment canada
over the last 30 years leading thinkers have taken us beyond mechanistic and reductionist analysis into systems theory and the critical boundary judgements that are fundamental to systems analysis in defining and discussing boundary conditions we also redefine values and facts imposed on hydrological and economic analysis that underpins decisions about government policy in water resources the repeal of legislation for distributed interventions waterefficient appliances and rainwater harvesting that was previously enacted to improve the security of a regional water supply system is examined as a case study the results of the analysis were defined by the costs and benefits that are inside or outside of the boundaries of legitimate and recognized consideration this paper refers to those differences as boundary conditions and considers how those boundary conditions affect the outcome of analysis setting of boundary conditions what is included what is excluded and assumptions in engineering and economic analysis dominates outcomes of decisions about government policy these insights have general application to development of government water policy the investigations outlined in this paper were combined to create an enhanced version of a systems analysis of a policy for setting targets for water savings on all new dwellings it was established using appropriate boundary conditions that a 40% target for water savings is feasible for south east queensland seq and provides a costbenefit ratio of 21 these results indicate that a policy of mandating targets for sustainable buildings would provide substantial benefits to the state of queensland water utilities and citizens
alzheimer's disease ad is an irreversible and highly progressive neurodegenerative disease clinically patients with ad display impairments in episodic and spatial memory however the underlying neuronal dysfunctions that result in these impairments remain poorly understood the hippocampus is crucial for spatial and episodic memory and thus we tested the hypothesis that abnormal neuronal representations of space in the hippocampus contribute to memory deficits in ad to test this hypothesis we recorded spikes from place cells in hippocampal subfield ca1 together with corresponding rhythmic activity in local field potentials in the 3xtg ad mouse model we observed disturbances in place cell firing patterns many of which were consistent with place cell disturbances reported in other rodent models of ad we found place cell representations of space to be unstable in 3xtg mice compared to control mice furthermore coordination of place cell firing by hippocampal rhythms was disrupted in 3xtg mice specifically a smaller proportion of place cells from 3xtg mice were significantly phaselocked to theta and slow gamma rhythms and the theta and slow gamma phases at which spikes occurred were also altered remarkably these disturbances were observed at an age before detectable a pathology had developed consistencies between these findings in 3xtg mice and previous findings from other ad models suggest that disturbances in place cell firing and hippocampal rhythms are related to ad rather than reflecting peculiarities inherent to a particular transgenic model thus disturbed rhythmic organization of place cell activity may contribute to unstable spatial representations and related spatial memory deficits in ad c 2017 wiley periodicals inc
we propose a new model of social influence which can occur spontaneously and in the absence of typically assumed motives we assume that perceivers routinely construct representations of other people's experiences and responses beliefs attitudes emotions and behaviors when observing others' responses or simulating the responses of unobserved others like representations made accessible by priming these representations may then influence the process that generates perceivers' own responses without intention or awareness especially when there is a strong social connection to the other we describe evidence for the basic properties and important moderators of this process which distinguish it from other mechanisms such as informational normative or social identity influence the model offers new perspectives on the role of others' values in producing cultural differences the persistence and power of stereotypes the adaptive reasons for being influenced by others' responses and the impact of others' views about the self
the reductionist approach of dissecting biological systems into their constituents has been successful in the first stage of the molecular biology to elucidate the chemical basis of several biological processes this knowledge helped biologists to understand the complexity of the biological systems evidencing that most biological functions do not arise from individual molecules; thus realizing that the emergent properties of the biological systems cannot be explained or be predicted by investigating individual molecules without taking into consideration their relations thanks to the improvement of the current omics technologies and the increasing understanding of the molecular relationships even more studies are evaluating the biological systems through approaches based on graph theory genomic and proteomic data are often combined with proteinprotein interaction ppi networks whose structure is routinely analyzed by algorithms and tools to characterize hubs/bottlenecks and topological functional and disease modules on the other hand coexpression networks represent a complementary procedure that give the opportunity to evaluate at system level including organisms that lack information on ppis based on these premises we introduce the reader to the ppi and to the coexpression networks including aspects of reconstruction and analysis in particular the new idea to evaluate largescale proteomic data by means of coexpression networks will be discussed presenting some examples of application their use to infer biological knowledge will be shown and a special attention will be devoted to the topological and module analysis
first introduced to egypt in 2006 h5n1 highly pathogenic avian influenza has resulted in the death of millions of birds and caused over 350 infections and at least 117 deaths in humans after a decade of viral circulation outbreaks continue to occur and diffusion mechanisms between poultry farms remain unclear using landscape genetics techniques we identify the distance models most strongly correlated with the genetic relatedness of the viruses suggesting the most likely methods of viral diffusion within egyptian poultry using 73 viral genetic sequences obtained from infected birds throughout northern egypt between 2009 and 2015 we calculated the genetic dissimilarity between h5n1 viruses for all eight gene segments spatial correlation was evaluated using mantel tests and correlograms and multiple regression of distance matrices within causal modeling and relative support frameworks these tests examine spatial patterns of genetic relatedness and compare different models of distance four models were evaluated: euclidean distance road network distance road network distance via intervening markets and a leastcost path model designed to approximate wild waterbird travel using niche modeling and circuit theory samples from backyard farms were most strongly correlated with least cost path distances samples from commercial farms were most strongly correlated with road network distances results were largely consistent across gene segments results suggest wild birds play an important role in viral diffusion between backyard farms while commercial farms experience humanmediated diffusion these results can inform avian influenza surveillance and intervention strategies in egypt c 2017 elsevier bv all rights

there are clear and compelling racial disparities in access to renal transplant which is the therapy of choice for many patients with end stage renal disease this paper conceptualizes the role of racism ie internalized personallymediated and institutionalized in creating and perpetuating these disparities at multiple levels of the social ecology by integrating two oftencited theories in the literature internalized racism is manifested at the intrapersonal level when for example african american patients devalue their selfworth thereby not pursuing the most aggressive treatment available personallymediated racism is manifested at the interpersonal level when for example physicians exhibit unconscious race bias that impacts their treatment decisions one example of institutionalized racism being manifested at the institutional community and public policy levels is the longstanding existence of racial residential segregation and empirically established links between neighborhood racial composition and dialysis facilitylevel transplantation rates this paper concludes with clinical research and policy recommendations
australia is a multicultural society however its history of british colonisation has contributed to enduring overt and covert discrimination racism and black/white racial divisions aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples are the recipients of ongoing racial discrimination they are the most disadvantage groups in australia and they are significantly overrepresented as social work clients an antiracist stance is core to social work practice and some literature has suggested that cultivating empathy can help reduce racism and provoke activism for social justice in 2014 a classroombased inquiry exploring barriers to activism extended previous studentcentred research exploring empathy and racism the findings suggest that some students hesitant to commit to action for social justice for reasons including a lack of confidence and a lack of time and information facilitating social work students' confidence increased understanding of everyday acts of activism and skill development including critical empathy may bolster their confidence and their action for social justice
this paper discusses the implementation of a burnup dependent fuel thermal conductivity model within the reactor dynamics and fuel modeling group rdfmg version of the subchannel thermalhydraulics code cobratf ctf the model takes into account the degradation of fuel thermal conductivity at high burnups and its dependence on the gadolinium content for both uo2 uranium dioxide and mox mixed oxide nuclear fuel rods the modified nuclear fuel industries nfi model for uo2 rods and the duriez/modified nfi model for mox rods were incorporated in ctf to validate the models the fuel centerline temperatures predicted with ctf were compared to halden reactor experimental data and to high fidelity frapcon34 calculations halden test cases for uo2 fuel rods at the beginning of life bol through lifetime with and without gd2o3; and for mox fuel rods were simulated with ctf it was demonstrated that ctf with the new burnup dependent fuel thermal conductivity model predicts the fuel centerline temperature with less than a 5% error as compared to the halden measurements ctf calculations were performed for fiftyeight 58 data points statistical analyses of the dimensionless predictedtomeasured fuel centerline temperature ratios had confirmed the advantage of the new model the mean value of the predictedtomeasured temperature ratios was increased from 08920 to 10082 and the standard deviation was decreased from 00693 to 00382 c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
although vaccination is a promising way to combat nicotine addiction most traditional haptenprotein conjugate nicotine vaccines only show limited efficacy due to their poor recognition and uptake by immune cells this study aimed to develop a hybrid nanoparticlebased nicotine vaccine with improved efficacy the focus was to study the impact of hapten density on the immunological efficacy of the proposed hybrid nanovaccine it was shown that the nanovaccine nanoparticles were taken up by the dendritic cells more efficiently than the conjugate vaccine regardless of the hapten density on the nanoparticles at a similar hapten density the nanovaccine induced a significantly stronger immune response against nicotine than the conjugate vaccine in mice moreover the high and mediumdensity nanovaccines resulted in significantly higher antinicotine antibody titers than their lowdensity counterpart specifically the highdensity nanovaccine exhibited better immunogenic efficacy resulting in higher antinicotine antibody titers and lower anticarrier protein antibody titers than the medium and lowdensity versions the highdensity nanovaccine also had the best ability to retain nicotine in serum and to block nicotine from entering the brain these results suggest that the hybrid nanoparticlebased nicotine vaccine can elicit strong immunogenicity by modulating the hapten density thereby providing a promising nextgeneration immunotherapeutic strategy against nicotine addiction c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
power is thought to increase discrimination toward subordinate groups yet its effect on different forms of implicit bias remains unclear we tested whether power enhances implicit racial stereotyping in addition to implicit prejudice ie evaluative associations and examined the effect of power on the automatic processing of faces during implicit tasks study 1 showed that manipulated high power increased both forms of implicit bias relative to low power using a neural index of visual face processing the n170 component of the erp study 2 revealed that power affected the encoding of white ingroup vs black outgroup faces whereas high power increased the relative processing of outgroup faces during evaluative judgments in the prejudice task it decreased the relative processing of outgroup faces during stereotype trait judgments an indirect effect of power on implicit prejudice through enhanced processing of outgroup versus ingroup faces suggested a potential link between face processing and implicit bias together these findings demonstrate that power can affect implicit prejudice and stereotyping as well as early processing of racial ingroup and outgroup faces

ad hoc networks are subject to multiple challenges particularly the problem of limited resources such as energy and vulnerability in terms of security indeed the nodes are subject to various attacks and malicious actions thus each mobile is confronted with a dilemma: cooperate to ensure security in this case the node spend a part of its energy or not cooperate which allows it to save energy but making the security of the network more vulnerable in this work we develop an approach which takes into account two conflicting objectives: contribute to network security while reducing energy consumption the approach is based on alternating two steps: clusteringevolutionary game the clustering step is performed by an algorithm that takes into account the energy constraint in election of clusterheads the interactions between each pair of clusterheads when exchanging data in their contribution to the security of the network are modeled as an evolutionary game which is the second step of the proposed approach
starting with a computational analysis of brightness matching we develop a novel variational framework able to model perceptual contextdriven effects that may be extended to nonphysical judgments as well the most important feature of the variational framework is the description of these phenomena as a suitable balance between contrast and dispersion the optimal balance is defined through the simultaneous minimization of functionals characterized by two terms in opposition to each other when the minimum is reached the equilibrium between contrast and dispersion is attained to show the flexibility of the proposed framework we discuss several examples of such functionals in the field of color perception and cognition which show adherence between theoretical predictions and empirical results with regard to social cognition theories the simultaneous occurrence of contrast and dispersion conflicts with sequential models thus supporting the idea of a concurrent presence of both effects in each judgment the variational framework can serve as a view from above on perceptual and cognitive phenomena that may help in deriving new constraints for disambiguating alternative theories c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved

implementing cloud computing empowers numerous paths for webbased service offerings to meet diverse needs however the data security and privacy has become a critical issue that restricts many cloud applications one of the major concerns in security and privacy is caused by the fact that cloud operators have chances to reach the sensitive data this concern dramatically increases users' anxiety and reduces the adoptability of cloud computing in many fields such as the financial industry and governmental agencies this paper focuses on this issue and proposes an intelligent cryptography approach by which the cloud service operators cannot directly reach partial data the proposed approach divides the file and separately stores the data in the distributed cloud servers an alternative approach is designed to determine whether the data packets need a split in order to shorten the operation time the proposed scheme is entitled securityaware efficient distributed storage saeds model which is mainly supported by our proposed algorithms including alternative data distribution adz algorithm secure efficient data distributions sed2 algorithm and efficient data conflation edcon algorithm our experimental evaluations have assessed both security and efficiency performances and the experimental results depict that our approach can effectively defend main threats from clouds and requires with an acceptable computation time c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
this paper presents descriptions and results of multiscale pullout and interface shear tests on a woven polypropylene pp geotextile reinforcement material in a marginal quality soil a main objective of these tests was to develop a moisture reduction factor mrf for the pullout resistance equation in the currently available design guidelines the tests were carried out at different overburden pressure and gravimetric water content gwc values the differences in the soilgeotextile interface strength among the cases with different gwc values were used to determine the corresponding mrf values results of the study indicate that the reinforcement interface strength and pullout resistance could decrease significantly as a result of the loss in the matric suction eg by 42% between the cases of 2% dry and 2% wet of the soil optimum moisture content it is concluded that wetting of the soilgeotextile interface during construction or service life of a reinforced soil structure can measurably reduce the interface strength and pullout resistance of the geotextile reinforcement which needs to be accounted for in design results of the study will be also useful to estimate the difference in the pullout capacity of geotextile reinforcement in a marginal soil when placed at different gwc values during construction the methodology described in the paper could be used to expand the database of mrf results to include a wider range of soil types and geotextile reinforcement for practical applications c 2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
this study considers a 1d fluid dynamics arterial network model with 14 vessels developed to assimilate ex vivo 0d temporal data for pressurearea dynamics in individual vessel segments from 11 male merino sheep a 0d model was used to estimate vessel wall parameters in a twoparameter elastic model and a fourparameter kelvin viscoelastic model this was done using nonlinear optimization minimizing the least squares error between model predictions and measured crosssectional areas subsequently estimated values for elastic stiffness and unstressed area were related to construct a nonlinear relationship this relation was used in the network model a 1d single vessel model of the aorta was then developed and used to estimate the inflow profile and parameters for total resistance and compliance for the downstream network and to demonstrate effects of incorporating viscoelasticity in the arterial wall lastly the extent to which vessel wall parameters estimated from ex vivo data can be used to realistically simulate pressure and area in a vessel network was evaluated elastic wall parameters in the network simulations were found to yield pressurearea relationships across all vessel locations and sheep that were in ranges comparable to those in the ex vivo data

the tongue is an elaborate complex of heterogeneous tissues with taste organs of diverse embryonic origins the lingual taste organs are papillae composed of an epithelium that includes specialized taste buds the basal lamina and a lamina propria core with matrix molecules fibroblasts nerves and vessels because taste organs are dynamic in cell biology and sensory function homeostasis requires tight regulation in specific compartments or niches recently the hedgehog hh pathway has emerged as an essential regulator that maintains lingual taste papillae taste bud and progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation and neurophysiological function activating or suppressing hh signaling with genetic models or pharmacological agents used in cancer treatments disrupts taste papilla and taste bud integrity and can eliminate responses from taste nerves to chemical stimuli but not to touch or temperature understanding hh regulation of taste organ homeostasis contributes knowledge about the basic biology underlying taste disruptions in patients treated with hh pathway inhibitors
background: measuring the agreement between a gene expression profile and a known transcriptional regulatory network is an important step in the functional interpretation of bacterial physiological state in this way general design principles can be explored one such interpretive framework is the relationship of digital control that is the impact of sequencespecific interactions and analog control ie the extent of the influence of chromosomal structure methods and results: here we present timeresolved gene expression profiles of escherichia coli's growth cycle as measured by rnaseq we extend methods which have been developed for discrete sets of differentially expressed genes and apply them to the wild type and two mutant timeseries for which the global transcriptional regulators fis and hns were inactivated we test our continuous methods using simulated 'expression profiles' generated from random boolean network dynamics where we observe a clear tradeoff between maximum response and level of detail included in the real timecourse expression data we find strong interdependent changes of digital and analog control during the exponential growth phase and a dominance of analog control during the stationary phase conclusions: our investigation puts forward a simple and reliable method for quantifying the match between timeresolved gene expression profiles and a transcriptional regulatory network the method reveals a systematic compensatory interplay of digital and analog control in the genetic regulation of e coli's growth cycle
benzene an important industrial solvent is also present in unleaded gasoline and cigarette smoke the hematotoxic effects of benzene in humans are well documented and include aplastic anemia pancytopenia and acute myelogenous leukemia however the risks of leukemia at low exposure concentrations have not been established a combination of metabolites hydroquinone and phenol for example may be necessary to duplicate the hematotoxic effect of benzene perhaps due in part to the synergistic effect of phenol on myeloperoxidasemediated oxidation of hydroquinone to the reactive metabolite benzoquinone because benzene and its hydroxylated metabolites phenol hydroquinone and catechol are substrates for the same cytochrome p450 enzymes competitive interactions among the metabolites are possible in vivo data on metabolite formation by mice exposed to various benzene concentrations are consistent with competitive inhibition of phenol oxidation by benzene in vitro studies of the metabolic oxidation of benzene phenol and hydroquinone are consistent with the mechanism of competitive interaction among the metabolites the dosimetry of benzene and its metabolites in the target tissue bone marrow depends on the balance of activation processes such as enzymatic oxidation and deactivation processes such as conjugation and excretion phenol the primary benzene metabolite can undergo both oxidation and conjugation thus the potential exists for competition among various enzymes for phenol zonal localization of phase i and phase ii enzymes in various regions of the river acinus also impacts this competition biologically based dosimetry models that incorporate the important determinants of benzene flux including interactions with other chemicals will enable prediction of target tissue doses of benzene and metabolites at low exposure concentrations relevant for humans

backgroundincreasing evidence supports that mentalization deficits may have a role in the genesis of young age depression; however few studies examined this issue in clinical populations methodsoutpatients aged 1421 suffering from various psychiatric disorders were assessed using the mentalization questionnaire mzq the beck depression inventory bdi and the childhood trauma questionnaire ctq using data from agematched healthy students for comparison the relationship between ctq mzq and bdi scores was examined at the crosssectional level including mediation analyses and longitudinally in a subsample who underwent a psychotherapy intervention resultsof 83 subjects 33 398% had mentalization levels that were 1 standard deviation below those of comparison subjects in the whole sample the levels of mentalization were inversely associated with bdi r68 p<001 and ctq scores r30 p006 moreover mzq scores mediated a large part of the effect of childhood trauma on depression total effect: 106 95% ci: 53 159; direct effect: 65 95% ci: 21 108; indirect effect: 41 95% ci: 15 74 this effect was almost entirely explained by the affect regulation subscale in patients reevaluated after four sessions n37 the decrease in bdi scores correlated with the increase in mzq scores r40 p02 conclusionsin a juvenile clinical sample deficits of mentalization abilities were associated with the severity of depression and explained part of the depressogenic effects of childhood trauma
several sources of information suggest that man evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega6 to omega3 fatty acids of approximately 1 whereas today this ratio is approximately 10:1 to 2025:1 indicating that western diets are deficient in omega3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their genetic patterns were established omega3 fatty acids increase bleeding time; decrease platelet aggregation blood viscosity and fibrinogen; and increase erythrocyte deformability thus decreasing the tendency to thrombus formation in no clinical trial including coronary artery graft surgery has there been any evidence of increased blood loss due to ingestion of omega3 fatty acids many studies show that the effects of omega3 fatty acids on serum lipids depend on the type of patient and whether the amount of saturated fatty acids in the diet is held constant in patients with hyperlipidemia omega3 fatty acids decrease lowdensitylipoprotein ldl cholesterol if the saturated fatty acid content is decreased otherwise there is a slight increase but at high doses 32 g they lower ldl cholesterol; furthermore they consistently lower serum triglycerides in normal subjects and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia whereas the effect on highdensity lipoprotein hdl varies from no effect to slight increases the discrepancies between animal and human studies most likely are due to differences between animal and human metabolism in clinical trials eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha in the form of fish oils along with antirheumatic drugs improve joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; have a beneficial effect in patients with ulcerative colitis; and in combination with drugs improve the skin lesions lower the hyperlipidemia from etretinates and decrease the toxicity of cyclosporin in patients with psoriasis in various animal models omega3 fatty acids decrease the number and size of tumors and increase the time elapsed before appearance of tumors studies with nonhuman primates and human newborns indicate that dha is essential for the normal functional development of the retina and brain particularly in premature infants because omega3 fatty acids are essential in growth and development throughout the life cycle they should be included in the diets of all humans omega3 and omega6 fatty acids are not interconvertible in the human body and are important components of practically all cell membranes whereas cellular proteins are genetically determined the polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa composition of cell membranes is to a great extent dependent on the dietary intake therefore appropriate amounts of dietary omega6 and omega3 fatty acids need to be considered in making dietary recommendations and these two classes of pufas should be distinguished because they are metabolically and functionally distinct and have opposing physiological functions their balance is important for homeostasis and normal development canada is the first country to provide separate dietary recommendations for omega6 and omega3 fatty acids

we present the easytouse sequence search tool for antimicrobial resistance sstar it combines a locally executed blastn search against a customizable database with an intuitive graphical user interface for identifying antimicrobial resistance ar genes from genomic data although the database is initially populated from a public repository of acquired resistance determinants ie argannot it can be customized for particular pathogen groups and resistance mechanisms for instance outer membrane porin sequences associated with carbapenem resistance phenotypes can be added and known intrinsic mechanisms can be included unique about this tool is the ability to easily detect putative new alleles and truncated versions of existing ar genes variants and potential new alleles are brought to the attention of the user for further investigation for instance sstar is able to identify modified or truncated versions of porins which may be of great importance in carbapenemasenegative carbapenemresistant enterobacteriaceae sstar is written in java and is therefore platform independent and compatible with both windows and unix operating systems sstar and its manual which includes a simple installation guide are freely available from https://githubcom/tomdemanbio/sequencesearchtoolforantimicrobialresistancesstar importance wholegenome sequencing wgs is quickly becoming a routine method for identifying genes associated with antimicrobial resistance ar however for many microbiologists the use and analysis of wgs data present a substantial challenge we developed sstar software with a graphical user interface that enables the identification of known ar genes from wgs and has the unique capacity to easily detect new variants of known ar genes including truncated protein variants current software solutions do not notify the user when genes are truncated and therefore likely nonfunctional which makes phenotype predictions less accurate sstar users can apply any ar database of interest as a reference comparator and can manually add genes that impact resistance even if such genes are not resistance determinants per se eg porins and efflux pumps
this study investigated person perception in respect of variables associated with affect in music tempo and mode following motor synchronization to music participants n 128 50% female were tested in a task involving stepping with a researcher to the beat of slow or fast music in major or minor mode following which measures concerning the synchronised partner were collected incidental memory likeability of similarity to and prosocial attitude towards significant effects were found only for the 'likeability' measure modulated by gender suggesting that variables associated with affect perception in music such as mode and tempo appear relevant for person perception in a synchronization task in ways that differ for men and women the results of this 'proof of concept' study indicate the need for further research on the effect of motor synchronization based on ecologically valid musical interaction tasks
three studies contribute to the literature on dominance and nonverbal behavior ellyson & dovidio 1985 by examining how a man's choice to shave his head influences person perception in study 1 men with shaved heads were rated as more dominant than similar men with full heads of hair in study 2 men whose hair was digitally removed were perceived as more dominant taller and stronger than their authentic selves study 3 extends these results with nonphotographic stimuli and demonstrates how men experiencing natural hair loss may improve their interpersonal standing by shaving theories of signaling norm violation and stereotypes are examined as explanations for the effect practical implications for men's psychological social and economic outlooks are also discussed

eventtriggered control aims at reducing the resource utilization especially the communication over the feedback link while guaranteeing a certain control performance although setpoint tracking problems are common in practice the majority of the proposed approaches in literature focus on regulation problems therefore an eventtriggered pi control design strategy with guaranteed performance is proposed in this paper where both the eventtriggering condition and the pi controller are implemented periodically based on a quadratic cost function the pi control design problem is introduced and formulated as an lmi optimization problem comparisons with other approaches in the literature are made by simulation and by experimental studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy
studies have revealed that upward social comparison on social network sites snss was a risk factor for depressive symptoms however little is known about the underlying processes that may mediate or moderate this relationship this study extended prior research by examining the mediating role of selfesteem and the moderating role of optimism in this relationship a sample of 1205 chinese undergraduate students completed measures of upward social comparison on snss depressive symptoms selfesteem and optimism results showed that selfesteem partially mediated the relation between upward social comparison on snss and depressive symptoms in addition the direct effect of upward social comparison on snss on depressive symptoms and the mediating effect of selfesteem were both moderated by optimism the two effects were more potent for individuals with low optimism than for those with high optimism the present study contributes to a better understanding of how and when upward social comparison on snss increases the risk of depressive symptoms limitations and implications of this study are discussed c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
tag is a popular children's playground game it revolves around taggers that chase and then tag runners upon which their roles switch there are many variations of the game that aim to keep children engaged by presenting them with challenges and different types of gameplay we argue that the introduction of sensing and floor projection technology in the playground can aid in providing both variation and challenge to this end we need to understand players' behavior in the playground and steer the interactions using projections accordingly in this paper we first analyze the behavior of taggers and runners in a traditional tag setting we focus on behavioral cues that differ between the two roles based on these we present a probabilistic role recognition model we then move to an interactive setting and evaluate the model on tag sessions in an interactive tag playground our model achieves 7796 % accuracy which demonstrates the feasibility of our approach we identify several avenues for improvement eventually these should lead to a more thorough understanding of what happens in the playground not only regarding player roles but also when the play breaks down for example when players are bored or cheat

digital microcontrollers/processors enable the costeffective control of gridconnected power converter systems in terms of system monitoring signal processing eg grid synchronization control eg grid current and voltage control etc normally the control is implemented in a microcontroller/processor with a fixed sampling rate considering the cost and complexity where the number of unit delays that have been adopted should be an integer for instance in conventional digital control systems a singlephase t/4 delay phaselocked loop pll system takes 50 unit delays ie in a 50hz system with a sampling frequency of 10khz to create a 90 degreeslagging voltage in order to achieve the grid synchronization with the orthogonal voltage system however in practice the grid frequency is a timevariant parameter due to various eventualities and thus rounding the number of the unit delays for the t/4 delay pll system should be done in its implementation this process will result in performance degradation in the digital control system as the exactly required number of delays is not realized hence in this paper a virtual unit delay vud has been proposed to address such challenges to the digital t/4 delay pll system the proposed vud adopts linear interpolation polynomial to approximate the fractional delay induced by the varying grid frequency in such a way that the control performance is enhanced the proposed vud has been demonstrated on a digitally controlled t/4 delay pll system experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposal
several epidemiological studies have suggested a possible link between exposure to diisononyl phthalate dinp and the development of allergies these findings remain controversial since there is insufficient scientific evidence to assess the ability of dinp to influence allergic immune responses in addition the mechanisms behind dinpcaused allergic diseases have not been fully elucidated in this study balb/c mice were orally exposed to dinp for 3 weeks and were then sensitized with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc we showed that oral exposure to dinp could aggravate allergicdermatitislike lesions indicated by an increase in the number of mast cells and in increased skin edema in fitcinduced contact hypersensitivity this deterioration was concomitant with increased total serum immunoglobuline and th2 cytokines we determined the oxidative damage and the activation of nuclear factorkb nfkb the data demonstrated that dinp could promote oxidative damage and the activation of nfkb in the skin the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin and the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcriptions 3 5 and 6 were enhanced concomitant with exacerbated allergic dermatitis effects and the activation of nfkb induced by dinp these effects were alleviated by pyrollidine dithiocarbamate an inhibitor of nfkb the results suggest that oral exposure to dinp aggravated allergic contact dermatitis which was positively regulated via nfkb
glycosylation of many proteins has been revealed to be closely related with food allergies and screening and structural analysis of related glycoproteins and glycoallergens are essential for studies in this field herein we describe detailed nglycoform analysis of all glycoprotein fractions of soybean protein isolate spi separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sdspage to disclose structural features of the glycan moieties of more soybean glycoproteins spi was fractionated by sdspage and the generated protein bands were recovered and subjected to ingel nglycan release and labeling using a onepot method newly developed by our group followed by detailed analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry esims and online hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry hilicesims/ms as a result we found seven bands mainly containing oligomannosetype glycans; two mainly contain core alpha 1 3facosylated glycans and six have no glycans this study is the first report that discovers core alpha 1 3fucosylated nglycans in bands 1 2 and 6 and discloses bands 3 4 5 and 7 as glycoproteins and their nglycoforms therefore it can expand our knowledge about soybean protein glycosylation and provide significant structural reference for research of soybean allergens
the severity of sustained injury resulting from assaultrelated violence can be minimised by reducing detection time however it has been shown that human operators perform poorly at detecting events found in video footage when presented with simultaneous feeds we utilise computer vision techniques to develop an automated method of abnormal crowd detection that can aid a human operator in the detection of violent behaviour we observed that behaviour in city centre environments often occurs in crowded areas resulting in individual actions being occluded by other crowd members we propose a realtime descriptor that models crowd dynamics by encoding changes in crowd texture using temporal summaries of grey level cooccurrence matrix features we introduce a measure of interframe uniformity and demonstrate that the appearance of violent behaviour changes in a less uniform manner when compared to other types of crowd behaviour our proposed method is computationally cheap and offers realtime description evaluating our method using a privately held cctv dataset and the publicly available violent flows ucf web abnormality and umn abnormal crowd datasets we report a receiver operating characteristic score of 09782 09403 08218 and 09956 respectively
although aesthetic preferences are known to be important in person perception and can play a significant role in everyday social decisions the effect of the age of the observer on aesthetic preferences for faces of different ages has not yet been fully investigated in the present study we investigated whether aesthetic preferences change with aging with an agerelated bias in favoring faces from one's own age group in addition we examined the role of age on both the perceptual qualities and the social attributes of faces that may influence these aesthetic judgements both younger and older adult observers provided ratings to images of younger middleaged and older unfamiliar faces as well as attractiveness the rating dimensions included other perceptual distinctiveness familiarity and social competence trustworthiness and dominance factors the results suggested a consistent aesthetic preference for youthful faces across all ages of the observers but surprisingly no evidence for an agerelated bias in attractiveness ratings older adults tended to provide higher ratings of attractiveness competence and trustworthiness to the unfamiliar faces consistent with the positivity effect previously reported we also tested whether perceptual factors such as face familiarity or distinctiveness affected aesthetic ratings only ratings of familiarity but not distinctiveness were positively associated with the attractiveness of the faces moreover ratings of familiarity decreased with increasing age of the face with regard to the social characteristics of the faces we found that the age of the face negatively correlated with ratings of trustworthiness provided by all observers but with the competence ratings of older observers only interestingly older adults provided higher ratings of perceived competence and trustworthiness to younger than older faces however our results also suggest that higher attractiveness ratings together with older aged faces led to more positive evaluations of competence the results are discussed within the context of an agerelated decline in the differentiation of faces in memory our findings have important implications for a better understanding of agerelated perceptual factors and cognitive determinants of social interactions with unfamiliar others across the adult lifespan

background: the complexity of rna regulation is one of the current frontiers in animal and plant molecular biology research rnabinding proteins rbps are characteristically involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation through interaction with rna recently the mrnabound proteome of mammalian cell lines has been successfully cataloged using a new method called interactome capture this method relies on uv crosslinking of proteins to rna purifying the mrna using complementary oligodt beads and identifying the crosslinked proteins using mass spectrometry we describe here an optimized system of mrna interactome capture for arabidopsis thaliana leaf mesophyll protoplasts a cell type often used in functional cellular assays results: we established the conditions for optimal protein yield namely the amount of starting tissue the duration of uv irradiation and the effect of uv intensity we demonstrated high efficiency mrnaprotein pulldown by oligod t 25 bead capture proteins annotated to have rnabinding capacity were overrepresented in the obtained medium scale mrnabound proteome indicating the specificity of the method and providing in vivo uv crosslinking experimental evidence for several candidate rbps from leaf mesophyll protoplasts conclusions: the described method applied to plant cells allows identifying proteins as having the capacity to bind mrna directly the method can now be scaled and applied to other plant cell types and species to contribute to the comprehensive description of the rbp proteome of plants
background the experience of 'sensed presence' a feeling or sense that another entity individual or being is present despite no clear sensory or perceptual evidence is known to occur in the general population appears more frequently in religious or spiritual contexts and seems to be prominent in certain psychiatric or neurological conditions and may reflect specific functions of social cognition or bodyimage representation systems in the brain previous research has relied on adhoc measures of the experience and no specific psychometric scale to measure the experience exists to date methods based on phenomenological description in the literature we created the 16item sensed presence questionnaire senpq we recruited participants from i a general population sample and; ii a sample including specific selection for religious affiliation to complete the senpq and additional measures of wellbeing schizotypy social anxiety social imagery and spiritual experience we completed an analysis to test internal reliability the ability of the senpq to distinguish between religiousand nonreligious participants andwhether the senpq was specifically related to positive schizotypical experiences and social imagery a factor analysis was also conducted examine underlying latent variables results the senpq was found to be reliable and valid with religious participants significantly endorsingmore items than nonreligious participants and the scale showing a selective relationship with construct relevant measures principal components analysis indicates two potential underlying factors interpreted as reflecting 'benign' and 'malign' ensed presence experiences discussion the senpq appears to be a reliable and valid measure of sensed presence experience although further validation in neurological and psychiatric conditions is warranted
the failure of the barlin dam in taiwan china offers an important case study for evaluating concepts in modeling the rapid erosion and channel recovery following intentional and unplanned dam removals we present a modeling effort that applied a 1d and quasi2d uncoupled hydraulics and sediment model netstars to evaluate how discretization and parameterization influence thefitofbed elevationpredictions to observations following dam failure our analysis evaluated the model sensitivity to sediment transport function active layer thickness and number of stream tubes used to define the crosssection results indicate that a the model is more sensitive to active layer thickness and sediment transport function than to the number of stream tubes b development of dam removal models are likely to benefit from varying the active layer thickness in time and c increased lateral discretization does not appear to improve model fit in the steep and rapidly changing river environment at our site we conclude with discussion on differences between identifying the need for and general use of 1d quasi2d and fully 2d models in dam removal and failure analysis c 2015 international research and training centre on erosion and sedimentation/the world association for sedimentation and erosion research published by elsevier bvall rights reserved

acute graftversushost disease gvhd remains a major complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a significant proportion of patients failing to respond to firstline systemic corticosteroids reliable biomarkers predicting disease severity and response to treatment are warranted to improve its management thus we sought to determine whether pentraxin 3 ptx3 an acutephase protein produced locally at the site of inflammation could represent a novel acute gvhd biomarker using a murine model of the disease we found increased ptx3 plasma levels after irradiation and at gvhd onset similarly plasma ptx3 was enhanced in 115 pediatric patients on day of transplantation likely due to conditioning and at gvhd onset in patients experiencing clinical symptoms of the disease ptx3 was also found increased in skin and colon biopsies from patients with active disease furthermore ptx3 plasma levels at gvhd onset were predictive of disease outcome since they resulted significantly higher in both severe and therapyunresponsive patients multiple injections of rhptx3 in the murine model of gvhd did not influence the disease course taken together our results indicate that ptx3 constitutes a biomarker of gvhd severity and therapy response useful to tailor treatment intensity according to early riskstratification of gvhd patients

play has been proposed as an indicator of positive emotions and welfare in higher vertebrates this study investigated playfulness in male rats by exploring its consistency across motivational states with/without prior short social isolation and two age points at early and late adolescence twentyfour male lister hooded rats housed in cages of four underwent two play tests: conspecific playinpairs and tickling by the experimenter which were compared with play in the home cage and basal anxiety levels playinpairs measures were consistent across age and motivational states and were independent from anxiety positively valenced vocalizations in the tickling test were also consistent across age yet were negatively related to anxiety playinpairs and tickling play contexts as well as social and solitary play types were unrelated therefore this study supports the existence of consistent individual differences in playfulness in rats and suggests that different play contexts and types represent motivationally distinct systems

assessment of attack surface is a formidable challenge for the presentday dynamic networks essentially attack surface of a computer network is a subset of network configuration and vulnerabilities that an adversary can use to compromise the target network in an incremental fashion there are a large number of metrics available for network security risk assessment however they fail to measure temporal variation in the network attack surface to overcome this problem we propose graph distance metrics based on the maximum common subgraph mcs and graph edit distance ged in particular we make use of classical graph distance metrics to quantify the distance between a pair of successive attack graphs generated for a dynamic network since the attack graph is capable of successfully capturing the attack surface of an underlying network the distance between a pair of consecutive attack graphs generated over the observed sampling interval indicates the change in the network attack surface to validate the efficacy and usability of graph distance metrics proposed in this study we have tested 11 different metrics on a set of 3 different network models viz flat externalinternal and dmz experimental results show that mcs and ged based graph distance metrics successfully capture the temporal variation in the attack surface and also generate an alert about the security events which are responsible for the change using such graph distance metrics we can pinpoint the events that cause a significant change in the network attack surface locate most dangerous hosts in the network and the effect of increasing vulnerabilities further on these hosts the advantage of using these metrics is that they scale polynomially with the graphs size and are independent of the graphs topology it is also evident from the test results that the performance of mcs and ged based metrics is almost similar and hence the computation of one metric is enough to detect temporal variation in the network attack surface the mcs and ged based graph distance metrics are oblivious to the and semantic between the initial conditions in the attack graphs thus there is a scope for improving their performance sensitivity by considering the and semantic c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

major depressive disorder mdd is associated with disrupted relationships with partners family and peers these problems can precipitate the onset of clinical illness influence severity and the prospects for recovery here we investigated whether individuals who have recovered from depression use interpersonal signals to form favourable appraisals of others as social partners twenty recovereddepressed adults with >1 adult episode of mdd but euthymic and medicationfree for six months and 23 healthy neverdepressed adults completed a task in which the gaze direction of some faces reliably cued the location a target valid faces whereas other faces cued the opposite location invalid faces no participants reported awareness of this contingency and both groups were significantly faster to categorise targets following valid compared with invalid gaze cueing faces following this task participants judged the trustworthiness of the faces whereas the healthy neverdepressed participants judged the valid faces to be significantly more trustworthy than the invalid faces; this implicit social appraisal was absent in the recovereddepressed participants individuals who have recovered from mdd are able to respond appropriately to joint attention with other people but appear to not use joint attention to form implicit trust appraisals of others as potential social partners
although frontal presentations of alzheimer's disease fvad have already been described in the literature we still know little about patients' social cognitive abilities especially their theory of mind tom we report the case of ft a 61yearold woman who was diagnosed with fvad two assessments of social cognition using a falsebelief task the reading the mind in the eyes test and a task probing knowledge of social norms were performed one year apart ft exhibited cognitive tom and social knowledge deficits from the onset affective tom was initially preserved but deteriorated as the disease progressed
voltage drifting islanding detection methods idms force the voltage at point of common coupling pcc to move outside the appropriate limits so that under/over voltage protection disconnects distributed generation dg units this kind of idms does not possess the advantage of keeping microgrid energized after islanding occurrence there are active idms without forcing the islanded microgrid to lose its stable operation but they degrade the power quality because of perturbation injection in this study an active idm is proposed which makes the second harmonic of pcc voltage drift suddenly after islanding occurrence and pass a predefined threshold value without affecting the fundamental component when islanding is detected the method is deactivated and the voltage and frequency remain in expected limits in the conditions of power balance another advantage of the proposed method is that it decreases the second harmonic of pcc voltage in gridconnected mode and improves the power quality of system unlike other active idms the ul 1741 test results show that the proposed method detects islanding occurrence in a multiinverter system in <100 ms also the correct performance of the proposed method has been shown for nonislanding conditions the paper simulations are performed using pscad/emtdc software
germline brca2 mutations are the first known cause of inherited familial pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pdac this tumor is the third most frequent cancer in carriers of germline brca2 mutations as it occurs in around 10% of brca2 families pdac is known as one of the most highly lethal cancers mainly because of its chemoresistance and frequently late diagnosis based on recent developments in molecular biology a subgroup of brca2associated pdac has been created allowing screening early surgical treatment and personalized systemic treatment brca2 germline mutation carriers who have >1 firstdegree relative or >2 blood relatives with pdac should undergo screening and regular followup based on magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound the goal of screening is to detect early invasive pdac and advanced precancerous lesions suitable for a stepwise surgical complete r0 resection increasing evidence on the molecular role of the brca2 protein in the homologous recombination of dna damages suggest that brca2related pdac are sensitive to agents causing dna crosslinking damage such as platinum salts and treatments targeting rescue dna repair pathways such as poly adpribose polymerase inhibitors that are currently under investigation
this paper presents a novel diagnosis method based on error voltage for 1gbts opencircuit faults in dualloop controlled voltagesource inverters the phase voltage changes when opencircuit faults occur and then there are error voltages of each phase which can be calculated directly by control algorithm with phase voltages and their corresponding flexible references both available from the main control system therefore the proposed diagnosis method requires no additional sensors or electrical circuits to detect opencircuit faults further with the features of fast diagnostic time being suitable for various load conditions strong robustness against false alarms and being easily inserted to the existing control algorithms as a subroutine the experimental results are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method
objectives: in this proofofconcept trial we examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of understanding social situations uss a new social cognitive intervention that targets higher level social cognitive skills using methods common to neurocognitive remediation including drill and practice and hierarchically structured training which may compensate for the negative effects of cognitive impairment on learning method: thirtyeight individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders completed the same baseline assessment of cognitive and social cognitive functioning twice over a 1month period to minimize later practice effects then received 710 sessions of uss training and then completed the same assessment again at posttreatment results: uss training was well tolerated and received high treatment satisfaction ratings large improvements on the uss skills test which contained items similar to but not identical to training stimuli suggest that we were effective in teaching specific training content content gains generalized to improvements on some of the social cognitive tasks including select measures of attributional bias and theory of mind importantly baseline neurocognition did not impact the amount of learning during uss as indexed by the uss skills test or the amount of improvement on social cognitive measures conclusions and implications for practice: uss shows promise as a treatment for higher level social cognitive skills given the lack of relationship between baseline cognition and treatment effects it may be particularly appropriate for individuals with lower range cognitive function
this research work deals with the landslide susceptibility assessment using analytic hierarchy process ahp and information value iv methods along a highway road section in constantine region ne algeria the landslide inventory map which has a total of 29 single landslide locations was created based on historical information aerial photo interpretation remote sensing images and extensive field surveys the different landslide influencing geoenvironmental factors considered for this study are lithology slope gradient slope aspect distance from faults land use distance from streams and geotechnical parameters a thematic layer map is generated for every geoenvironmental factor using geographic information system gis ; the lithological units and the distance from faults maps were extracted from the geological database of the region the slope gradient slope aspect and distance from streams were calculated from the digital elevation model dem contemporary land use map was derived from satellite images and field study concerning the geotechnical parameters maps they were determined making use of the geotechnical data from laboratory tests the analysis of the relationships between the landsliderelated factors and the landslide events was then carried out in gis environment the auc plot showed that the susceptibility maps had a success rate of 77 and 66% for iv and ahp models respectively for that purpose the iv model is better in predicting the occurrence of landslides than ahp one therefore the information value method could be used as a landslide susceptibility mapping zonation method along other sections of the a1 highway
the export coefficient model ecm has been widely used to estimate nonpoint source nps pollution loads due to its ease of application accurate pollution export coefficients are crucial for reducing uncertainties in load estimation by integrating artificial simulated rainfall experiments with field survey data we have developed a new method that estimates regional pollution export coefficients results showed that the export coefficients calculated using this new method accurately express the regional rainfallrunoff characteristics as the simulation precision of this method had grown by 30% than the results with traditional ecm and export coefficients which surveyed from the literature based on the calculated regional pollutant export coefficient the annual loads of tn and tp in the plains area of the baiyangdian basin in 2010 were 25 96713 t and 434929 t respectively among different types of sources rural livestock had the greatest contribution over 60% whereas rural domestic waste represented the smallest contribution approximately 10% of the different sources pigs contributed almost half of all nps pollution from livestock rural residential areas were the main land use pollution source and rural living garbage was the main source of rural domestic waste spatially nps was mainly distributed in the zhulong and juma watersheds other watersheds only contributed approximately 5% nps per watershed however the perarea loads of these lower load watersheds were larger or nearly equal to that of the zhulong watershed therefore the lower load watersheds should be addressed for the control of nps pollution
arctic river icings are surface ice accumulations that can be >10km 2 in area and >10m thick they commonly impact the hydrology geomorphology and ecology of arctic river environments previous examination of icing dynamics in arctic alaska found no substantial changes in extent through 2005 however here we use daily time series of satellite imagery for 20002015 to demonstrate that the temporal persistence and minimum summertime extent of large icings in part of arctic alaska and canada have declined rapidly we identified 122 large ephemeral icings and 70 are disappearing significantly earlier in the summer with a mean trend of 1609day 1 for fully ephemeral features additionally 14 of 25 icings that usually persist through the summer have significantly smaller minimum extents 2616%yr 1 these declines are remarkably rapid and suggest that arctic hydroclimatic systems generating icings and their associated ecosystems are changing rapidly plain language summary liquid water emerging from groundwater and flowing through arctic rivers during the winter often freezes into large ice features which are called river icings these icings which are found in nearly all parts of the arctic create wide gravelly river channels that can be important habitat for animals when icings melt during the summer they help keep rivers flowing when other water sources are limited up until now no study has systematically looked at whether these features are changing in response to warming temperatures we use daily satellite imagery available over northern alaska from 2000 to 2015 in order to test whether icings are becoming smaller or disappearing earlier in the summer of 147 features examined we found that 84 are either becoming smaller for those that persist throughout the summer or are disappearing earlier for those that fully melt each summer none are becoming larger or disappearing later these changes may be directly related to warming temperatures but they may also be happening because climate change is altering how rivers and groundwater interact if these trends continue we may see changes in the form of many arctic rivers and impacts on the habitat of animals like fish and caribou

how do varying levels of intergroup contact affect voter preferences in connection with ethnically radical political candidates and parties? two competing hypotheses have emerged in the last 60 years: the first known as the group threat hypothesis argues that voters from an ethnic or religious group in more ethnically or racially heterogeneous districts will exhibit stronger preferences for ethnically radical political candidates the contact hypothesis argues that groups living in mixed localities are actually less likely to support ethnic radicals both perspectives have found empirical support but no previous study has offered a theoretical explanation for two seemingly contradictory conclusions we specify just such a theory arguing that the effect of district level integration is conditioned by the direction of a group's share of the national population we test this theory quantitatively using electoral data from northern ireland between 1983 and 2010
the jiuquan satellite launch center jslc is a relatively isolated special zone in the northwest region of china the potential risk to the energy supply security and the pressure of national greenhouse gas emissions reduction clearly indicates the jslc's need to lower its dependency on imported fossil fuels and electricity this article presents a feasibility analysis on the available hybrid energy system based on the renewable energy availability and local electricity demand estimation in 2020 through homer model the simulation results indicate that cost of energy coe of the three proposed options are 0127 0033 and 0123 $/kwh respectively it also shows that the proposed hybrid renewable energy systems can reduce carbon emissions by 4070% compared to electricity from the existing power grid a sensitivity analysis reveals that the coe has a significant positive relationship with carbon price and discount rate whereas carbon price shows a significantly distinct impact on the coe for different options considered the optimization results also show that a gridconnected renewable power system comprised of wind power and natural gas power plant is the most economic and environmentfriendly energy supply option for jslc however a hybrid re system with a local energy storage facility can better guarantee the energy supply safety considering the special function and security needs of the jslc this study verified that constructing new coal fired power plants is not a suitable choice from both the cost effectiveness and kenvironmental protection perspectives c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
ferroxidase activity has been reported to be altered in various biological fluids in neurodegenerative disease but the sources contributing to the altered activity are uncertain here we assay fractions of serum and cerebrospinal fluid with a newly validated triplex ferroxidase assay our data indicate that while ceruloplasmin a multi copper ferroxidase is the predominant source of serum activity activity in csf predominantly derives from a < 10 kda component specifically from polyanions such as citrate and phosphate we confirm that in human biological samples ceruloplasmin activity in serum is decreased in alzheimer's disease but in csf a reduction of activity in alzheimer's disease originates from the polyanion component

research on fungal pathogens with the aim to identify virulence determinants strictly relies on the generation of defined recombinant strains a task that is executed by means of a sophisticated molecular biology toolbox recent developments in fungal genome engineering have opened a new frontier by implementing the crisprcas9 technology based on expression of the cas9 endonuclease that is loaded by a single guiding rna sgrna molecule to target a defined site in the recipient genome this novel approach has been adapted successfully to engineer fungal genomes among them the one of the humanpathogenic mould aspergillus fumigatus implementation of the required components was achieved by various means that differ with respect to expression of the cas9 enzyme and sgrna delivery validation of crisprcas9mediated mutagenesis could be executed by targeting selected candidate genes of a fumigatus to provide a promising perspective for screening and multiplexing approaches to scrutinize the virulome of this opportunistic fungal pathogen in a comprehensive manner such as by analyzing genetic polymorphisms or the function of gene families
background and objectives: safety behavior sb is detrimental to the beneficial effects of exposure because it prevents patients from obtaining evidence that disconfirms their excessive threat beliefs however previous studies showed that cleaning sb during exposure to a contaminant does not prevent a reduction in feelings of contamination fear of contamination danger and disgust cfdd we aimed to directly examine the effect of sb during exposure to a contaminant on threat beliefs associated with cfdd method: healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: repeated exposure to a contaminant whilst abstaining from sb exposure plus response prevention; e + rp ; with the use of disinfectant wipes after each instance of exposure exposure plus sb; e + sb ; or no exposure or safety behavior control condition participants identified their threat belief associated with the contaminant and rated cfdd and the degree to which they believed their threat belief at the pre and posttest results: the e + rp and e + sb condition resulted in a larger decrease of cfdd and threat belief ratings than the control condition whereas these reductions did not differ between the e + rp and e + sb condition limitations: results were obtained from a nonclinical sample and with a single session of exposure conclusion: cleaning sb did not impede the beneficial effects of exposure c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the terrestrial dayglow displays prominent emission features from the 00 and 11 bands of the o2 atmospheric band system in the 760780nm region we present an analysis of observations in this wavelength region recorded by the space shuttle during the arizona airglow experiment a major conclusion is that the dominant product of o d1 +o2 energy transfer is o2 b v1 a result that corroborates our previous laboratory studies moreover critical to the interpretation of dayglow is the possible interference by n2 and n2 + bands in the 760780nm region where the singlemost important component is the n2 1pg 31 band that overlaps with the o2 bx 00 band when present this background must be accounted for to reveal the o2 bx 00 and 11 bands for altitudes at which the o2 and n2/n2 + emissions coincide finally we exploit the very different collisional behavior of the two lowest o2 b vibrational levels to outline a remote sensing technique that provides information on atmospheric composition and temperature from spacebased observations of the 00 and 11 o2 atmospheric bands
previous research has provided qualitative evidence for overlap in a number of brain regions across the subjective value network svn and the default mode network dmn in order to quantitatively assess this overlap we conducted a series of coordinatebased metaanalyses cbma of results from 466 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments on tasknegative or subjective valuerelated activations in the human brain in these analyses we first identified significant overlaps and dissociations across activation foci related to svn and dmn second we investigated whether these overlapping subregions also showed similar patterns of functional connectivity suggesting a shared functional subnetwork we find considerable overlap between svn and dmn in subregions of central ventromedial prefrontal cortex cvmpfc and dorsal posterior cingulate cortex dpcc further our findings show that similar patterns of bidirectional functional connectivity between cvmpfc and dpcc are present in both networks we discuss ways in which our understanding of how subjective value sv is computed and represented in the brain can be synthesized with what we know about the dmn mindwandering and selfreferential processing in light of our findings

mobility management has become a core function in internet services and networks as mobile devices have been widely used and their capabilities have dramatically advanced it is expected that proxy mobile ipv6 pmipv6 which is the most prominent solution will play an important role in supporting these devices' mobility to protect pmipv6 networks several authentication schemes have been presented however due to their static approach the existing schemes failed to keep a good balance between security and efficiency motivated by this the authors study an adaptive authentication scheme for mobile devices in pmipv6 networks in particular the proposed scheme considers mobile nodes' context information to decide authentication strength based on which adaptive authentication is performed it is shown from the formal security verification and the example study that the proposed scheme is not only correct but also achieves a good tradeoff between security and efficiency
the rapid and timely evaluation of urban environmental change is highly important for understanding urban sustainability in china however the comprehensive understanding of urban environmental change in china based on multisource remote sensing data remains inadequate because current studies have mainly focused on a single aspect of the urban environment using a specific source of remote sensing data in this study we developed a comprehensive evaluation index cei combining the remote sensing data of the fine particulate matter pm25 concentration land surface temperature 1st and vegetation cover vc to assess the urban environmental change in china at the national scale among urban agglomerations and across the rapidly urbanized regions we found a trend of environmental degradation in the urban areas of china between 2000 and 2012 environmentally degraded and moderately degraded urban areas accounted for 4814% of the total urban area in china in particular the expanded urban areas exhibited the most extensive environmental degradation with 5233% of the total expanded urban areas from 1992 to 2012 exhibiting environmental degradation or moderately environmental degradation the increase in the pm25 concentration was one of the main manifestations of the environmental degradation in the expanded urban areas we suggest that more attention should be paid to urban environmental issues during future urban development in china c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved
the viral supergroup includes the entire collection of known and unknown viruses that roam our planet and infect life forms the supergroup is remarkably diverse both in its genetics and morphology and has historically remained difficult to study and classify the accumulation of protein structure data in the past few years now provides an excellent opportunity to reexamine the classification and evolution of viruses here we scan completely sequenced viral proteomes from all genome types and identify protein folds involved in the formation of viral capsids and virion architectures viruses encoding similar capsid/coat related folds were pooled into lineages after benchmarking against published literature remarkably the in silico exercise reproduced all previously described members of known structurebased viral lineages along with several proposals for new additions suggesting it could be a useful supplement to experimental approaches and to aid qualitative assessment of viral diversity in metagenome samples

ownership of a smartphone has never been easier nowadays and it is supported by the fact that most of the people around us have a smartphone or an equivalent smart device what is smartphone and why is it a smart? a smartphone by definition is as the name suggests it is a phone is smart enough to not only be limited to the features and capabilities of a traditional cellular phone but also perform what a smart device can and in recent years the device that is deemed as the most intelligent device is the computer as it is the most advance piece of technology that is commercially available to the general public why this is so is because in our opinion it has revolutionized how most if not all of the societies of today work hence what makes a smartphone is the mobile operating system that it is built upon which is similar to a computer it is becoming more and more of a common sight nowadays and this is because they are being offered at a price where more people are able to afford hence they are reaching the hands of ceiling of the lower income families all the way up to the higher income families back then pure play devices were mostly simple in terms of how it function and works hence if possible we could suggest that the security aspect was never or rather has never been an issue other than the alteration of data after operation such as the tape of video recorders or images captured but never in the process in the sense that there were no interruptions during operation most likely is because it was clear and visible but nowadays when you combine all of those devices into a complex entity we tend to leave a hole in the cloth somewhere that we did not or rather can't see due to the overwhelming amount of other things that we have in this paper we discuss the current state of the commercially available operating systems of the two biggest names in smart devices namely ios and android; and measure how secure and/or vulnerable susceptible are they to malwares and the nature of the mobile ad hoc network we first analyze the integrity of the core of a smart device the operating system and then use it to evaluate the effectiveness of their techniques and defenses of preventing and identifying malwares
grandparenting has been proposed as an ultimate evolutionary mechanism that has contributed to the increase in human life expectancy see the grandmother hypothesis the neural and hormonal system originally rooted in parenting and thus grandparenting that is activated in the process of caregiving has been suggested as a potential proximate mechanism that promotes engagement in prosocial behavior towards kin and nonkin alike evidence and theory suggest that activating this caregiving system positively impacts health and may reduce the mortality of the helper although some studies have found grandparental care to have beneficial effects on grandparents' health outcomes most studies have focused on the detrimental health consequences of providing custodial care for grandchildren little is known about how noncustodial grandparental and other forms of care giving relate to mortality hazards for the care provider using an evolutionary framework we examined whether caregiving within and beyond the family is related to mortality in older adults survival analyses based on data from the berlin aging study revealed that mortality hazards for grandparents who provided noncustodial childcare were 37% lower than for grandparents who did not provide childcare and for nongrandparents these associations held after controlling for physical health age socioeconomic status and various characteristics of the children and grandchildren furthermore the effect of caregiving extended to nongrandparents and to childless older adults who helped beyond their families potential ultimate and proximate mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
the overall performance of an electric machine is closely linked to the thermal design of the machine and there is a trend to include more thermal analysis into the machine design procedure in academic literature thus there is also a motivation to prototype experimental machines for accurate validations of the thermal analysis one of the challenges is to measure rotor temperatures online while the machine is in operation this paper presents some of the experience from designing an online temperature monitoring system for an experimental ipmsm in total 32 sensors was successfully placed inside the 34 liter volume of the small ipmsm and temperature data was transmitted from the rotor in the end of the shaft using infrared light it was found that the online temperature monitoring system was very reliable both the used analog and digital sensors exhibit equal results and emi immunity when placed inside the electromagnetically noisy environment inside the machine
this research examines the implications of consumers' belief in karmathe belief that the universe bestows rewards for doing right and exacts punishments for doing wrongin the context of prosocial behavior although intuitively believing in karma should result in greater intentions to do right by supporting a charity karmic beliefs are found to facilitate prosocial behavior only in contexts not associated with selfgains a series of experiments shows that those with strong vs weak beliefs in karma actually respond less favorably to charitable appeals that rely on common marketing tools meant to enhance consumer responses but that also cue selfgains by offering incentives or by highlighting selfbenefits however these effects are only obtained for donations of time which represent a means to enhance social connections but not for donations of money consistent with the proposition that prosocial behaviors motivated by selfgains do not engender karmic rewards lower intentions to do right among those with strong karmic beliefs are driven by a shift from otherfocused to selffocused attention following appeals that cue selfgains as compared to appeals that do not results imply that marketers need to take into account consumers' karmic beliefs when seeking to incentivize prosocial behavior

in a typical entanglementbased quantum key distribution qkd protocols the maximally entangled singlet states are used the standard way to generate them is to use parametric down conversion with low intensity laser beams this way the probability to produce two or more entangled pairs is negligible however one obtains it at a cost of a large likelihood of producing no particles at all in this work we ask the question if this approach is the optimal one from the point of view of key generation rate for a case study we take bbm 92 protocol and find the optimal intensity of the beam we show optimal intensities are much higher than the ones typically used our results can be generalized to other protocols based on singlet states
feature selection is a significant task in data mining and machine learning applications which eliminates irrelevant and redundant features and improves learning performance in many realworld applications collecting labeled data is difficult while abundant unlabeled data are easily accessible this motivates researchers to develop semisupervised feature selection methods which use both labeled and unlabeled data to evaluate feature relevance however tilltodate there is no comprehensive survey covering the semi supervised feature selection methods in this paper semisupervised feature selection methods are fully investigated and two taxonomies of these methods are presented based on two different perspectives which represent the hierarchical structure of semisupervised feature selection methods the first perspective is based on the basic taxonomy of feature selection methods and the second one is based on the taxonomy of semi supervised learning methods this survey can be helpful for a researcher to obtain a deep background in semi supervised feature selection methods and choose a proper semisupervised feature selection method based on the hierarchical structure of them
astronomy is in an era where allsky surveys are mapping the galaxy the plethora of photometric spectroscopic asteroseismic and astrometric data allows us to characterize the comprising stars in detail here we quantify to what extent precise stellar observations reveal information about the properties of a star including properties that are unobserved or even unobservable we analyze the diagnostic potential of classical and asteroseismic observations for inferring stellar parameters such as age mass and radius from evolutionary tracks of solarlike oscillators on the lower main sequence we perform rank correlation tests in order to determine the capacity of each observable quantity to probe structural components of stars and infer their evolutionary histories we also analyze the principal components of classic and asteroseismic observables to highlight the degree of redundancy present in the measured quantities and demonstrate the extent to which information of the model parameters can be extracted we perform multiple regression using combinations of observable quantities in a grid of evolutionary simulations and appraise the predictive utility of each combination in determining the properties of stars we identify the combinations that are useful and provide limits to where each type of observable quantity can reveal information about a star we investigate the accuracy with which targets in the upcoming tess and plato missions can be characterized we demonstrate that the combination of observations from gala and plato will allow us to tightly constrain stellar masses ages and radii with machine learning for the purposes of galactic and planetary studies
in this work we consider optical flow on evolving riemannian 2manifolds which can be parametrised from the 2sphere our main motivation is to estimate cell motion in timelapse volumetric microscopy images depicting fluorescently labelled cells of a live zebrafish embryo we exploit the fact that the recorded cells float on the surface of the embryo and allow for the extraction of an image sequence together with a spherelike surface we solve the resulting variational problem by means of a galerkin method based on vector spherical harmonics and present numerical results computed from the aforementioned microscopy data
estimating the nature and extent of human cancer risks due to arsenic as in drinking water is currently of great concern since millions of persons worldwide are exposed to arsenic primarily through natural enrichment of drinking water drawn from deep wells humans metabolize and eliminate as through oxidative methylation and subsequent urinary excretion while there is debate as to the role of methylation in activation/detoxification variations in arsenic metabolism may affect individual risks of toxicity and carcinogenesis using data from three populations from mexico china and chile we have analyzed the distribution in urine of total arsenic and arsenic species inorganic arsenic inas monomethyl arsenic mma and dimethyl arsenic dma data were analyzed in terms of the concentration of each species and by evaluating mma:dma and mma + dma :inas ratios in all persons most urinary as was present as dma male:female differences were discernible in both high and lowexposure groups from all three populations but the gender differences varied by populations the data also indicated bimodal distributions in the ratios of dma to inas and to mma while the gene or genes responsible for arsenic methylation are still unknown the results of our studies among the ethnic groups in this study are consistent with the presence of functional genetic polymorphisms in arsenic methylation leading to measurable differences in toxicity this analysis highlights the need for continuing research on the health effects of as in humans using molecular epidemiologic methods c 2003 elsevier science usa all rights reserved
this paper presents a new contentbased synthetic aperture radar sar image retrieval method to search out sar image patches which consists of two essential parts: an initial retrieval and later refined results to obtain the proper initial retrievals we develop a similarity measure named regionbased fuzzy matching rfm to evaluate the similarities between sar image patches first to reduce the negative influence of speckle noise we segment the sar image patches into brightnesstexture regions at the superpixel level rather than the pixel level second a multiscale edge detector is utilized to resolve the multiscale property of the sar image patches and then the edge regions of the sar image patches are defined by those edge features third to overcome the segmented uncertainty and the blurry boundaries the obtained regions are described by fuzzy features finally the rfm similarity between two sar image patches is converted into the linear summation of the resemblance between different fuzzy feature sets after we obtain the initial retrieval results the multiple relevance feedback mrf scheme is proposed to refine the original ranked list in this scheme different relevance feedback approaches are carried out respectively and then their results are fused to improve the initial retrieval in addition a new kernel function based on the rfm measure is developed for mrf the encouraging experimental results counted on a manually constructed ground truth sar image patch dataset demonstrate that our retrieval method is effective for sar images compared with some existing approaches proposed in the remote sensing community
the nasa soil moisture active passive smap satellite mission was launched on january 31 2015 to provide global mapping of highresolution soil moisture and freezethaw state every 23 days using an lband active radar and an lband passive radiometer the level 2 radiometeronly soil moisture product l2_sm_p provides soil moisture estimates posted on a 36km earthfixed grid using brightness temperature observations from descending passes this paper provides the first comparison of the validatedrelease l2_sm_p product with soil moisture products provided by the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos aquarius advanced scatterometer ascat and advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 missions this comparison was conducted as part of the smap calibration and validation efforts smap and smos appear most similar among the five soil moisture products considered in this paper overall exhibiting the smallest unbiased rootmeansquare difference and highest correlation overall smos tends to be slightly wetter than smap excluding forests where some differences are observed smap and aquarius can only be compared for a little more than two months; they compare well especially over low to moderately vegetated areas smap and ascat show similar overall trends and spatial patterns with ascat providing wetter soil moistures than smap over moderate to dense vegetation smap and amsr2 largely disagree in their soil moisture trends and spatial patterns; amsr2 exhibits an overall dry bias while desert areas are observed to be wetter than smap
differential susceptibility theory proposes that a subset of individuals exist who display enhanced susceptibility to both negative riskpromoting and positive developmentenhancing environments this experiment represents the first attempt to directly test this assumption by exposing children in the experimental group to both negative and positive feedback using puppet roleplays it thereby serves as an empirical test as well as a methodological primer for testing differential susceptibility dutch children n 190 453% girls between the ages of 4 and 6 years participated we examined whether negative and positive feedback would differentially affect changes in positive and negative affect in prosocial and antisocial intentions and behavior depending on children's negative emotionality results show that on hearing negative feedback children in the experimental group increased in negative affect and decreased in positive affect more strongly than children in the control group on hearing positive feedback children in the experimental group tended to increase in positive affect and decrease in prosocial behavior however changes in response to negative or positive feedback did not depend on children's negative emotionality moreover using reliable change scores we found support for a subset of vulnerable children but not for a subset of susceptible children the findings offer suggestions to guide future differential susceptibility experiments c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
automatic computation of surface correspondence via harmonic map is an active research field in computer vision computer graphics and computational geometry it may help document and understand physical and biological phenomena and also has broad applications in biometrics medical imaging and motion capture industries although numerous studies have been devoted to harmonic map research limited progress has been made to compute a diffeomorphic harmonic map on general topology surfaces with landmark constraints this work conquers this problem by changing the riemannian metric on the target surface to a hyperbolic metric so that the harmonic mapping is guaranteed to be a diffeomorphism under landmark constraints the computational algorithms are based on ricci flow and nonlinear heat diffusion methods the approach is general and robust we employ our algorithm to study the constrained surface registration problem which applies to both computer vision and medical imaging applications experimental results demonstrate that by changing the riemannian metric the registrations are always diffeomorphic and achieve relatively high performance when evaluated with some popular surface registration evaluation standards
noting that general military regulations gmr contain numerous references to aspects of nonverbal behavior expressed as prescribed behavior we considered necessary a new reading of gmr as nonverbal communication handbooks this new reading is possible and it reveals important aspects with regard to opportunities of education or adequate training in agreement with some good knowledge in the field of communication sciences this paper aims at setting up a prescriptive nonverbal profile of the romanian soldiers in relation to behavioral requirements resulting from the current gmr of the romanian armed forces the research method consists of documents analysis and comprises: 1 placement of four general normative documents into a different context a communicative one ; 2 identification of explicit and implicit nonverbal communication prescriptions included in the body of these normative texts; 3 analysis of the nonverbal prescription in relationship with the major classes of nonverbal behavior and 4 configuration of a nonverbal profile of romanian soldiers based on the gmr behavioral prescriptions in this respect the paper is similar with some projective or normative documents regulations memoranda etc developed by institutions such as the army research institute for behavioral and social sciences and the committee on opportunities in basic behavioral and social sciences research of the us army katz et al 2006; blascovitch & hartel 2008; yager et al 2009 etc designed to identify the role of nonverbal communication in the military context especially in the context of intercultural actions in different theaters of operations following this study we intend to focus our future research in the field of nonverbal communication on the romanian military context in order to subsequently build a first necessary instrument for the development of nonverbal communicative competence within the romanian armed forces
since in situ preservation of archaeological material has become more widespread european union 1992 the need to stop an active attack of teredo navalis a woodboring mollusc on waterlogged archaeological wood has become more urgent the aim of current study is to examine the ability of two plastic materials terram4000 and a plastic membrane to stop both initial attack by t navalis and their effects on wood with active woodborer degradation blocks of pinewood were submerged in the southern part of the kattegat in denmark where shipworm is known to be prolific after settling and attack had been confirmed the blocks were removed and wrapped in either terram4000 polypropylene and polyethylene or a proprietary plastic membrane polyethylene normally used on fishing piles or piers as a protection against shipworm in denmark an optical oxygen sensor was packed together with each block to measure the amount of available oxygen around the wood after one week the oxygen level around the test blocks wrapped in the plastic membrane had dropped drastically and lead to the death of all shipworms within the test blocks after onefour weeks although no new shipworm attacked the wood wrapped in terram4000 the geotextile did not impede the passage of oxygenated seawater as living individuals were found in the blocks after 46 weeks of wrapping and submersion c 2013 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
background: to evaluate the immunomodulating and clinical effects of nilotinib a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in a proofofconcept study in spondyloarthritis spa assessing the mast cell as potential novel therapeutic target in this disease methods: twenty eight patients with active peripheral pspa and/or axial spa axspa were included in a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled clinical trial trial registration: trialregisternl ntr2834 patients were treated 1:1 with nilotinib or placebo for 12 weeks followed by an open label extension for another 12 weeks paired synovial tissue biopsies serum sampling and assessment of clinical symptoms were performed serially results: in pspa n 13 synovial inflammation appeared to diminish after 12 weeks of nilotinib treatment as evidenced by histopathology decrease in number of infiltrating cd68+ and cd163+ macrophages and mast cells compared to placebo mrna expression of ckit as mast cell marker p 0037 and of proinflammatory cytokines such as il6 p 0024 were reduced the reduction of synovial inflammation was paralleled by a decrease in serum biomarkers of inflammation such as creactive protein p 0024 and calprotectin p 0055 also clinical parameters such as patient's global assessment of disease activity p 0031 and ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score p 0031 showed improvement upon 12 weeks of nilotinib but not placebo treatment this improvement was further augmented at week 24 in contrast to pspa neither serum biomarkers of inflammation nor clinical parameters improved upon nilotinib treatment in axspa during the trial one serious adverse event occurred which was considered unrelated to the study drug conclusions: this small proofofconcept study suggests that nilotinib treatment modulates inflammation and clinical symptoms in pspa a similar effect was not seen in axspa

in recent years research on magnesium mg alloys had increased significantly for hard tissue replacement and stent application due to their outstanding advantages firstly mg alloys have mechanical properties similar to bone which avoid stress shielding secondly they are biocompatible essential to the human metabolism as a factor for many enzymes in addition main degradation product mg is an essential trace element for human enzymes the most important reason is they are perfectly biodegradable in the body fluid however extremely high degradation rate resulting in too rapid loss of mechanical strength in chloride containing environments limits their applications engineered artificial biomaterials with appropriate mechanical properties surface chemistry and surface topography are in a great demand as the interaction between the cells and tissues with biomaterials at the tissueimplant interface is a surface phenomenon; surface properties play a major role in determining both the biological response to implants and the material response to the physiological condition therefore the ability to modify the surface properties while preserve the bulk properties is important and surface modification to form a hard biocompatible and corrosion resistant modified layer have always been an interesting topic in biomaterials field in this article attempts are made to give an overview of the current research and development status of surface modification technologies of mg alloys for biomedical materials research further the advantages/disadvantages of the different methods and with regard to the most promising method for mg alloys are discussed finally the scientific challenges are proposed based on own research and the work of other scientists

as a primary disturbance agent fire significantly influences local processes and services of forest ecosystems although a variety of remote sensing based approaches have been developed and applied to landsat mission imagery to infer burn severity at 30 m spatial resolution forest burn severity have still been seldom assessed at fine spatial scales 5 m from veryhighresolution vhr data we assessed a 432 ha forest fire that occurred in april 2012 on long island new york within the pine barrens region a unique but imperiled firedependent ecosystem in the northeastern united states the mapping of forest burn severity was explored here at fine spatial scales for the first time using remotely sensed spectral indices and a set of multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis mesma fraction images from bitemporal pre and postfire event worldview2 wv2 imagery at 2 m spatial resolution we first evaluated our approach using 1 m by 1 m validation points at the subcrown scale per severity class ie unburned low moderate and high severity from the postfire 010 m color aerial orthophotos; then we validated the burn severity mapping of georeferenced dominant tree crowns crown scale and 15 m by 15 m fixedarea plots intercrown scale with the postfire 010 m aerial orthophotos and measured crown information of twenty forest inventory plots our approach can accurately assess forest burn severity at the subcrown overall accuracy is 84% with a kappa value of 077 crown overall accuracy is 82% with a kappa value of 076 and intercrown scales 89% of the variation in estimated burn severity ratings ie geocomposite burn index cbi this work highlights that forest burn severity mapping from vhr data can capture heterogeneous fire patterns at fine spatial scales over the large spatial extents this is important since most ecological processes associated with fire effects vary at the <30 m scale and vhr approaches could significantly advance our ability to characterize fire effects on forest ecosystems c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved
vocalizations of anuran amphibians have received much attention in studies of behavioral ecology and physiology but also provide informative characters for identifying and delimiting species we here review the terminology and variation of frog calls from a perspective of integrative taxonomy and provide handson protocols for recording analyzing comparing interpreting and describing these sounds our focus is on advertisement calls which serve as premating isolation mechanisms and therefore convey important taxonomic information we provide recommendations for terminology of frog vocalizations with call note and pulse being the fundamental subunits to be used in descriptions and comparisons however due to the complexity and diversity of these signals an unequivocal application of the terms call and note can be challenging we therefore provide two coherent concepts that either follow a notecentered approach defining uninterrupted units of sound as notes and their entirety as call or a callcentered approach defining uninterrupted units as call whenever they are separated by long silent intervals in terminology based on surveys of literature we show that numerous call traits can be highly variable within and between individuals of one species despite idiosyncrasies of species and higher taxa the duration of calls or notes pulse rate within notes and number of pulses per note appear to be more static within individuals and somewhat less affected by temperature therefore these variables might often be preferable as taxonomic characters over call rate or note rate which are heavily influenced by various factors dominant frequency is also comparatively static and only weakly affected by temperature but depends strongly on body size as with other taxonomic characters strong call divergence is typically indicative of specieslevel differences whereas call similarities of two populations are no evidence for them being conspecific taxonomic conclusions can especially be drawn when the general advertisement call structure of two candidate species is radically different and qualitative call differences are thus observed on the other hand quantitative differences in call traits might substantially vary within and among conspecific populations and require careful evaluation and analysis we provide guidelines for the taxonomic interpretation of advertisement call differences in sympatric and allopatric situations and emphasize the need for an integrative use of multiple datasets bioacoustics morphology genetics particularly for allopatric scenarios we show that smallsized frogs often emit calls with frequency components in the ultrasound spectrum although it is unlikely that these high frequencies are of biological relevance for the majority of them and we illustrate that detection of upper harmonics depends also on recording distance because higher frequencies are attenuated more strongly bioacoustics remains a prime approach in integrative taxonomy of anurans if uncertainty due to possible intraspecific variation and technical artifacts is adequately considered and acknowledged
in recent years more and more research has been conducted in close collaboration with manufacturers to design robust and profitable dismantling systems thus engineers and designers of new products have to consider constraints and disassembly specifications during the design phase of products not only in the context of the end of life but more precisely in the product life cycle consequently optimization of disassembly process of complex products is essential in the case of preventive maintenance in fact disassembly sequence plan dsp which is among the combinatorial problems with hard constraints in practical engineering becomes an nphard problem in this research work an automated dsp process based on a metaheuristic method named ant colony optimization is developed beginning with a computer aided design cad model a collision analysis is performed to identify all possible interferences during the components' motion and then an interference matrix is generated to identify dynamically the disassembly parts and to ensure the feasibility of disassembly operations the novelty of the developed approach is presented in the introduction of new criteria such as the maintainability of the usury component with several other criteria as volume tools change and disassembly directions change finally to highlight the performance of the developed approach an implemented tool is developed and an industrial case is studied the obtained results prove the satisfactory side of these criteria to identify a feasible dsp in a record time
laboratory triaxial compression tests were conducted to investigate the stressstrainvolumetric responses of geotextilereinforced sand and the mobilization and distribution of reinforcement strain/loads and soilgeotextile interface shear stress within reinforced soil geotextilereinforced sand specimens were tested while varying the confining pressures and number of geotextile reinforcement layers a digital imageprocessing technique was applied to determine residual tensile strain of the reinforcements after tests and to estimate reinforcement tensile loads experimental results indicate that the geotextile reinforcement enhanced peak shear strength and axial strain at failure and reduced loss of postpeak shear strength the reinforced specimen had higher shear strength when compared with that of unreinforced soil after deforming by 13% of axial strain which indicates that the geotextile requires a sufficient deformation to mobilize its tensile force to improve the shear strength of reinforced soil for each reinforcement layer mobilized tensile strain peaked at the center of the reinforcement and decreased along the radial direction while the interface shear stress was zero at the center and peaked at a distance of 0507 reinforcement radius from the center the mobilized tensile strain of reinforcement increases as confining pressure and number of reinforcement layers increase this work also demonstrates that the strength difference between reinforced and unreinforced soil was strongly correlated with the sum of maximum mobilized tensile forces of all reinforcement layers indicating that mobilized tensile force of reinforcements directly improved the shear strength of reinforced soil last a number of analytical models to predict peak shear strength of reinforced soil are verified experimentally this verification demonstrates that mobilized tensile force rather than ultimate tensile strength can be used in analytical models

the measurement of core losses in electrical steel laminations is considered an essential step in the machine design process accordingly the calibration of the tangential field sensor for measurements of magnetic field strength h is of importance in core loss measurements for estimation of electrical machine efficiency due to the stray field between the lamination surface and the tangential coil a concern is raised regarding the certainty of the measured field this paper presents a reliable technical approach to calibrate the tangential field sensor used in the investigation of core losses in electrical machine laminations which compensates for the drop in the actual field value the proposed approach is based on developing a magnetizing circuit which consists of two test laminations an array of hall effect sensors is used in this study as a reference for the tangential field the calibration results show that the magnetic field strength measured at the specimen surface by the tangential coil is scaled down by 457% of the actual field the results are verified experimentally and validated by finiteelement simulations based on the obtained results a correction factor is applied on pulsating and rotational core losses to attain more accurate data
the objective of this study was to reveal the molecular mechanism involved in carbapenem resistance and virulence of a k2 klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolate 24835 the virulence of the strain was determined by in vitro and in vivo methods the de novo wholegenome sequencing technology and molecular biology methods were used to analyze the genomic features associated with the carbapenem resistance and virulence of k pneumoniae 24835 strain 24835 was highly resistant to carbapenems and belonged to st14 exhibited hypermucoviscous and unique k2aerobactinkfurmpa positive phenotype as the only carbapenemase gene in strain 24835 bla ndm 5 was located on a 46kb incx3 selftransmissible plasmid which is a very close relation of pndmmgr194 from india genetic context of blandm 5 in strain 24835 was closely related to those on incx3 plasmids in various enterobacteriaceae species in china the combination of multiple virulence genes may work together to confer the relative higher virulence in k pneumoniae 24835 significantly increased resistance to serum killing and mice mortality were found in the virulent new delhi metallobeta lactamase ndm producing k pneumoniae strain compared to the other ndmproducing k pneumoniae strain our study provides basic information of phenotypic and genomic features of k pneumoniae 24835 a strain displaying carbapenem resistance and relatively high level of virulence these findings are concerning for the potential of ndmlike genes to disseminate among virulent k pneumoniae isolates
zebrafish have become a popular animal model for studying the development of alcohol addiction several behavioral paradigms for studying alcohol addiction have been developed for zebrafish including conditioned place preference alcoholinduced tolerance and withdrawal however alcohol choice preference tasks have not been established in zebrafish as of yet the ability of zebrafish to detect alcohol in their environment is required in alcohol choice or preference tasks to our knowledge it is currently unknown whether zebrafish are able to detect alcohol in their environment immediately following bath immersion in the current study we analyzed the time course of alcoholinduced behavioral changes of zebrafish while being immersed in alcohol solution in a 15 l tank we recorded each trial in highdefinition and quantified behavioral responses using automated video trackingbased and manual observationbased methods to quantify temporal changes in alcoholinduced behaviors as alcohol is known to require several minutes of bath immersion to reach the brain in zebrafish we argued that behavioral responses before this time point would prove zebrafish's ability to detect this substance in the water our results show that a 60min exposure to 1% alcohol alters behavioral responses in a timedependent manner notably alcohol exposure significantly increased absolute turn angle decreased distance to bottom and variance of distance to bottom within the first 3 min immediately following exposure a response that occurred before alcohol could reach the brain of the subjects in measurable amounts these results imply that zebrafish are able to detect alcohol in their environment immediately following immersion into the drug solution
seawater viscosity is influenced by temperature as well as through excretion of exopolymers by some plankton we examined the role of viscosity on the movement patterns and sensory abilities of the dinoflagellate heterocapsa triquetra manipulating the viscosity of seawater to simulate a 10 +/ 15 degrees c temperature change in a second treatment we seeded the water with microbeads to examine swimming behaviours in the presence of a mechanical stimulus increased viscosity reduced distances between conspecifics 47fold and increased distances between protists and microbeads by 34fold increased viscosity also affected other aspects of motility with an overall reduction in swimming speed of 20and 70fold for treatments with and without mechanical stimuli higher viscosities were associated with upward vertical migration in both the presence and absence of microbeads cells were highly sensitive to disturbances to the velocity field by as little as 15% and different approach distances of h triquetra to conspecifics over mechanical stimuli suggest sensory capacity to distinguish types of particles mediation of motility and migratory behaviours through viscosity implies ramifications for the distribution of protists and their encounters with resources predators and conspecifics triggered by events such as temperature changes and phytoplankton bloom events

visual perception is a fundamental component for most robotics systems operating in human environments specifically visual recognition is a prerequisite to a large variety of tasks such as tracking manipulation humanrobot interaction as a consequence the lack of successful recognition often becomes a bottleneck for the application of robotics system to realworld situations in this paper we aim at improving the robot visual perception capabilities in a natural humanlike fashion with a very limited amount of constraints to the acquisition scenario in particular our goal is to build and analyze a learning system that can rapidly be retrained in order to incorporate new evidence if available to this purpose we review the stateoftheart codingpooling pipelines for visual recognition and propose two modifications which allow us to improve the quality of the representation while maintaining realtime performances: a coding scheme best code entries bce and a new pooling operator midlevel classification weights mlcw the former focuses entirely on sparsity and improves the stability and computational efficiency of the coding phase the latter increases the discriminability of the visual representation and therefore the overall recognition accuracy of the system by exploiting data supervision the proposed pipeline is assessed from a qualitative perspective on a humanrobot interaction hri application on the icub platform quantitative evaluation of the proposed system is performed both on inhouse robotics data sets icubworld and on established computer vision benchmarks caltech256 pascal voc 2007 as a byproduct of this work we provide for the robotics community an implementation of the proposed visual recognition pipeline which can be used as perceptual layer for more complex robotics applications c 2016 published by elsevier bv
piezoelectric fans have been studied extensively and are seen as a promising technology for thermal management due to their ability to provide quiet reliable cooling with low power consumption the fluid mechanics associated with a piezoelectric fan are similar to that for a flapping bird wing which are known to be complex this paper is the first to investigate the threedimensional fluid mechanics of an unconfined fan operating in its first vibration frequency mode a custom built experimental facility was developed to capture the fan's flow field using twodimensional phase locked particle image velocimetry piv the fluidstructure interaction was also captured through unique twoway coupled threedimensional simulations of an oscillating beam in which the beam is actuated by a shear force at its resonant frequency and interacts with the surrounding air this forgoes the need for temporal beam displacement data from experiments as in previous studies allowing the numerical technique to be used independently a finite element method is used for the simulations which allows the twoway coupling while maintaining computational efficiency a three dimensional lambda 2 criterion constructed from interpolated piv measurements as well as numerical data was used to identify a horse shoe vortex in the vicinity of the fan and its evolution into a hairpin vortex before it breaks up due to a combination of vortex shedding and flow along the fan blade the experimental and numerical data are comparatively in agreement confirming that the methods presented are valid for capturing the complex flow fields generated by this fluidstructure interaction the results provide both a fundamental understanding on the formation and breakup of vortices from an oscillating beam and demonstrate a validated approach which can be applied in the development of high efficiency piezoelectrically driven air moving devices and extended to the study of flapping bird and uav wings
it is important to determine the mechanical properties of reinforced soils since they are extensively used in practice in this study laboratory triaxial tests and direct shear tests were carried out in order to determine the stressstrain and dilation characteristics of geotextilereinforced river sand the mechanical behaviour of the composite material was investigated through varying the type of geotextile and confining pressure interface properties of geotextilereinforced samples were evaluated with the direct shear tests the results demonstrated that geotextile inclusion increases the peak strength and reduces dilation especially at higher confining pressures
recently concerns have been raised that adolescents' prolific social media use may cause them to become less empathic however direct empirical evidence is missing and research suggests that social media use can also be beneficial for adolescents' psychosocial development the present study aims to investigate whether and how social media use influences empathy we surveyed 942 dutch adolescents 1014 years twice with a oneyear interval the results showed that social media use is related to an increase in cognitive and affective empathy over time specifically adolescents' social media use improved both their ability to understand cognitive empathy and share the feelings of their peers affective empathy c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
purpose of review the task of cataloging human genetic variation and its relation to disease is rapidly approaching completion the new challenge is to discover the function of diseaseassociated genes and to understand the pathways that lead to human disease we propose that achieving this new level of understanding will increasingly rely on the use of model organisms we discuss the advantages of the mouse as a model organism to our understanding of human disease recent findings the collection of available mouse strains represents as much genetic and phenotypic variation as is found in the human population however unlike humans mice can be subjected to experimental breeding protocols and the availability of tissues allows for a far greater and deeper level of phenotyping new methods for gene editing make it relatively easy to create mouse models of known human mutations the distinction between genetic and epigenetic inheritance can be studied in great detail various experimental protocols enable the exploration of the role of the microbiome in physiology and disease summary we propose that there will be an interdependence between human and model organism research technological advances and new genetic screening platforms in the mouse have greatly improved the path to gene discovery and mechanistic studies of gene function
this paper discusses diffusion of a pulsed magnetic field into a resistive element fabricated from a lowcarbon steel the developed numerical model shows that the process of the magnetic field diffusion into the steel at the leading edge of the pulse can be conventionally described by three stages: initial stage extending up to saturation of the steel surface layers stage of saturation when the discharge current diffuses into the bulk of the steel and stage of conduction when the discharge current is distributed practically uniformly in the steel approximate analytical relations describing the voltage drop across the resistive element are derived for each of the three stages these relations are used for estimation of the effect of the ferromagnetic properties of the steel on transients in electrical circuits with the resistive element experiments prove the validity of the obtained analytical results
this paper proposes a faultlocation algorithm for ultrahighvoltage untransposed parallel transmission lines that only use the voltages and currents at the local end the proposed algorithm uses the voltage equation for the faulted phase of the faulted line the equation contains the fault distance fault resistance and fault current to obtain the fault current kirchhoff's voltage law is applied on the loops of three phases consisting of the faulted line and the adjacent parallel line the fault current can be represented in terms of the fault distance inserting the fault current into the voltage equation results in an equation that contains only two parameters ie the fault distance and fault resistance the fault distance is estimated by solving the equation test results indicated that the algorithm accurately estimates the fault distance regardless of the fault resistance and mutual coupling effects

the rising number of newly insured young adults brought on by health care reform will soon increase demands on primary care physicians physicians will face more young adult patients which presents an opportunity for more preventionoriented care in the present study we evaluated whether brief observer reports of young adults' personality traits could predict which individuals would be at greater risk for poor health as they entered midlife following the cohort of 1 000 individuals from the dunedin multidisciplinary health and development study moffitt caspi rutter & silva 2001 we show that very brief measures of young adults' personalities predicted their midlife physical health across multiple domains metabolic abnormalities cardiorespiratory fitness pulmonary function periodontal disease and systemic inflammation individuals scoring low on the traits of conscientiousness and openness to experience went on to develop poorer health even after accounting for preexisting differences in education socioeconomic status smoking obesity selfreported health medical conditions and family medical history moreover personality ratings from peer informants who knew participants well and from a nurse and receptionist who had just met participants for the first time predicted health decline from young adulthood to midlife despite striking differences in level of acquaintance personality effect sizes were on par with other wellestablished health risk factors such as socioeconomic status smoking and selfreported health we discuss the potential utility of personality measurement to function as an inexpensive and accessible tool for health care professionals to personalize preventive medicine adding personality information to existing health care electronic infrastructures could also advance personality theory by generating opportunities to examine how personality processes influence doctorpatient communication health service use and patient outcomes
maximum distance separable mds matrices are employed to create diffusion layers in block ciphers and hash functions mds matrices are generated by linear codes to reduce the cost for software or hardware implementations however linear codes can only generate a limited number of mds matrices in a finite field as a consequence many block ciphers adopt the same matrices this paper describes the design of a generator to create a large number of different mds matrices at the same time by changing parameters of the high dimensional cat map named a multimds matrix generator we identify three types of cat matrices which can be used to construct a multimds matrix generator in addition we prove that the proposed mds matrices with a small number of both different elements and xor gates are efficient in terms of implementation performance finally we show that the multimds matrix generator inherits the dynamical properties of the highdimensional cat map improving the resistance of diffusion layers against the powerful techniques of cryptanalysis c 2016 elsevier gmbh all rights reserved
this investigation explores the relationship between verbal and nonverbal communication and coexistence in school settings among 30 fourth grade students between the ages of 8 and 11 from a district school the data collection methods used were the participant observation and the semistructured interview after analyzing the information recorded it is shown that students identify the characteristics of verbal and nonverbal communication and link them to their social behavior at school; thus the article acknowledges the importance of communication and coexistence habits learned at home and which together with those acquired at school become patterns that guide their behavior this favors the understanding of coexistence processes in schools
it has been suggested that dogs' ability to comprehend human pointing gestures evolved as a byproduct of the socioemotional changes associated with domestication given the large role played by the oxytocin system in socioemotional processes it is possible to hypothesize a role for oxytocin in modulating dogs' sociocommunicative skills indeed it has been shown that intranasal oxytocin enhances dogs' ability to use human pointing cues in an object choice task a classic paradigm used to assess the ability to follow a pointing gesture we further tested this hypothesis in another sample of dogs and replicated the above findings we also provided a novel explanation to the above findings suggesting that oxytocin released during humandog interactions increases the positive expectations about human behaviour via emotion and reward processes and thus facilitates the interpretation of pointing as leading to positive events given the large and deep homology across mammals in the neural mechanisms involved in emotions oxytocin could be involved in the acquisition of sociocommunicative skills during human typical as well as pathological development
phototropin1 is a blue light bl receptor in plants and shows bldependent kinase activation the blexcited lightoxygenvoltagesensing domain 2 lov2 is primarily responsible for the activation of the kinase domain; however the molecular mechanism by which conformational changes in lov2 are transmitted to the kinase domain remains unclear here we investigated blinduced structural changes of a minimum functional fragment of arabidopsis phototropin1 composed of lov2 the kinase domain and a linker connecting the two domains using smallangle xray scattering saxs the fragment existed as a dimer and displayed photoreversible saxs changes reflected in the radii of gyration of 429 angstrom in the dark and 488 angstrom under bl irradiation in the dark the molecular shape reconstructed from the saxs profiles appeared as two beanshaped lobes in a twisted arrangement that was 170 angstrom long 80 angstrom wide and 50 angstrom thick the molecular shape under bl became slightly elongated from that in the dark by fitting the crystal structure of the lov2 dimer and a homology model of the kinase domain to their inferred shapes the bldependent change could be interpreted as the positional shift in the kinase domain relative to that of the lov2 dimer in addition we found that lysine 475 a functionally important residue in the nterminal region of lov2 plays a critical role in transmitting the structural changes in lov2 to the kinase domain the interface between the domains is critical for signaling suitably changing the structure to activate the kinase in response to conformational changes in the adjoining lov2

a key aspect of realizing the future smart grid communication solution is a balanced approach between the network performance and the network security during the network deployment a high security communication flow path is not useful when the network path cannot support capacity and reachability requirements the deployment phase in communication network can facilitate an optimal network path by focusing on both the network performance and the network security at the same time in this paper we describe a use case of smart grid application where security network capacity and reachability needs to be optimal for successful network operation we explain our proposed balancing approach of the network performance and the network security which can be useful for the optimal smart grid secure system design
in this paper a theoretical and experimental analysis of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar sar architectures is undertaken for sea oil slick observation purposes reference is made to the conventional fullpolarimetric fp sar that is here contrasted with newgeneration polarimetric sar architectures known as compactpolarimetric cp sar two cp modes are considered ie the hybridpolarity and pi/4 modes whose measurements are emulated from actual land cband fp sar data polarimetric sea surface scattering is predicted according to an extended version of the bragg scattering model xbragg in order to point out the differences exhibited between fp and cp sar architectures and among cp sar modes theoretical predictions are then contrasted with experiments undertaken on actual polarimetric sar data collected over wellknown oil slicks and weakdamping surfactants results confirm model prediction showing that differences mainly apply when polarimetric features are estimated over slickfree sea surface using different sar architectures with the pi/4 mode behaving closer to fp sar although cp sar architectures measure only a subset of the fp information content they represent an interesting operational alternative for both detecting oil slicks and discriminating them from weakdamping surfactants
in englishspeaking western cultures the punitive attitudes towards lawbreakers is well documented the present study examines the utility of predictors of punitive attitudes with online survey data obtained from a convenience sample of 566 australian residents after controlling for demographic variables the study examines the utility of two theoretical models; the crimedistrust model and the racialanimus model in predicting punitive attitudes all three factors of the crimedistrust model significantly predict punitive attitudes the study extends the current literature through identifying the significance of negative perceptions of indigenous australians in predicting punitive attitudes to sentencing results suggest that community perception of indigenous australians is a significant predictor of punitive attitudes in addition to factors of the crimedistrust model future research using a more representative sample of the australian population is recommended to increase the confidence with which findings are interpreted
backgroundpatients frequently report antibiotic allergies; however only 10% of labelled patients have a true allergy aimwe investigated the documentation of antibiotic allergy' labels aal and the effect of labelling on clinical outcomes in a west australian adult tertiary hospital methodsretrospective crosssectional analysis of patients captured in the 2013 and 2014 national antimicrobial prescribing surveys was carried out data were collected on documented antibiotic adverse drug reactions antibiotic cost prescribing appropriateness prevalence of multidrug resistant organisms length of stay intensive care admission and readmissions resultsof the 687 patients surveyed 278 40% were aged 70 or above 365 53% were male and 279 41% were prescribed antibiotics aal were recorded in 122 18% patients and the majority were penicillin labels n87; 71% details of aal were documented for 80 of 141 57% individual allergy labels with 61 describing allergic symptoms patients with betalactam allergy labels received fewer penicillins p00002 and more aminoglycosides p0043 and metronidazole p0021 than patients without betalactam labels five patients received an antibiotic that was contraindicated according to their allergy status patients with aal had significantly more hospital readmissions within 4 weeks p0001 and 6 months p0025 of discharge compared with unlabelled patients the majority 81% of readmitted labelled patients had major infections conclusions aal are common but poorly documented in hospital records patients with aal are significantly more likely to require alternative antibiotics and hospital readmissions there may be a role for antibiotic allergy delabelling to mitigate the clinical and economic burdens for patients with invalid allergy labels
alzheimer's disease ad is a devastating and progressive neurodegenerative disease and is characterized pathologically by the accumulation of amyloid beta a beta and the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins in the brain the deposition of a beta aggregates triggers synaptic dysfunction hyperphosphorylation of tau and neurodegeneration which lead to cognitive disorders here we investigated the neuroprotective effect of fisetin in the a beta 142 mouse model of ad single intracerebroventricular injections of a beta 142 3 mu l/5 min/mouse markedly induced memory/synaptic deficits neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration intraperitoneal injections of fisetin at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks starting 24 h after a beta 142 injection significantly decreased the a beta 142 induced accumulation of a beta bace1 expression and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein at serine 413 fisetin treatment also markedly reversed a beta 142 induced synaptic dysfunction by increasing the levels of both presynaptic syn and snap25 and postsynaptic proteins psd95 snap23 pglur1 ser 845 pcreb ser 133 and pcamkii thr 286 and ultimately improved mouse memory as observed in the morris water maze test fisetin significantly activated ppi3k pakt ser 473 and pgsk3 beta ser 9 expression in a beta 142 treated mice moreover fisetin prevented neuroinflammation by suppressing various activated neuroinflammatory mediators and gliosis; it also suppressed the apoptotic neurodegeneration triggered by a beta 142 injections in the mouse hippocampus fluorojadeb and immunohistochemical staining for caspase3 revealed that fisetin prevented neurodegeneration in a beta 142 treated mice our results suggest that fisetin has a potent neuroprotective effect against a beta 142 induced neurotoxicity these results demonstrate that polyphenolic flavonoids such as fisetin could be a beneficial effective and safe neuroprotective agent for preventing neurological disorders such as ad
we investigated whether blackwhite biracial individuals are perceived as black in the domain of evaluation previous research has documented that white perceivers' negative evaluation of one black person leads to a negative implicit evaluation of another black person belonging to the same minimal group we built upon this outgroup transfer effect by investigating whether perceivers also transferred negative implicit attitudes from one black person to a novel blackwhite biracial person in three experiments participants learned about a black individual who performed undesirable behaviors and were then introduced to a new group member white perceivers formed negative attitudes toward the original individual and transferred these attitudes to the new group member if she was black or biracial but not if she was white experiment 1 or asian experiment 2 experiment 3 demonstrated that only white participants exhibited transfer to the new black and biracial group members; black participants did not
this research studies the emptyingbox problem with a porous baffle just behind the entrance opening a theoretical model is extended to include the effect of a porous baffle and the theoretical model taking account of porosity establishes the connections between two typical unidirectional displacement flow types the saltbath technique is employed to conduct the experiments using an acrylic reducedscale model dye attenuation technique is used to analyze the light intensity data derived from the recorded images of experiments according to the baffle porosity percentage phi the experiments are categorized into two series em 79% and em 60% each series respectively includes three different opening area ratios which are 1 05 and 033 experimental results show that emptying processes for the cases with a baffle of the larger porosity percentage consist of emptying the dense layer and emptying the mixed layer but there is only one process of emptying the dense layer for the cases with a baffle of the smaller porosity percentage experimental results are in reasonable agreement with the extended theoretical model developed in this research two extreme cases those with and without an impenetrable baffle are included in this paper to represent two typical flow types of the horizontal inflow denoted as em h as that with phi 0% and the vertical inflow denoted as em v as that with phi 100% ie the unidirectional classical displacement flow and the displacement flow with interfacial mixing as the porosity percentage increases the emptying time for the dense layer decreases but the emptying time for the whole box tends to increase the emptying time for the dense layer decreases when the total effective opening area or the reduced gravity increases for the cases having the same porosity percentage the initial interfacial height of the mixed layer increases as the baffle porosity percentage increases for the cases having the fixed total effective opening area or the total effective opening area increases for the cases with the same baffle porosity percentage the initial buoyancy of the mixed layer is dependent on the penetrative entrainment flow rate from the dense layer to the mixed layer and the emptying time for the dense layer as the total effective opening area or the porosity percentage increases experimental results show that the initial buoyancy of the mixed layer tends to increase and the penetrative entrainment flow rate increases as well but the emptying time for the dense layer decreases c 2015 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

the antibiotic water pollution caused by discharge of untreated antibiotic waste water and sewage from animal husbandry is increasingly severe especially in developing countries however current water treatment methods for antibioticpolluted water are complicated expensive and time consuming here we have developed a highly effective enzymatic ultrafiltration membrane which is extremely simple and can degrade antibiotic in a fast manner at a lowcost penicillinase a representative enzyme for antibiotic degradation was covalently immobilized in bromomethylated poly 2 6dimethyl1 4phenylene oxide bppo ultrafiltration membrane by a simple selfassembling process the membrane immobilized with penicillinase can thoroughly degrade the antibiotic by a single passing of the polluted water with a treatment capacity up to 335 lm 2 h 1 a small piece of membrane ca 25 cm 2 can provide sufficient clean drinking water for a family 4 people 10 l per day overnight furthermore the engineered enzymatic membrane has an attractive stability and reusability for longterm application we anticipate that our enzymatic membrane will serve as a practical and lowcost solution to antibiotic pollution in particular for providing antibioticfree drinking water in developing countries c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
this work was undertaken to determine the genesis and role of creativity cr in the formation of mental qualities that gave homo sapiens hs the evolutionary advantages in intra and interspecific competition during the period of the intraspecific bifurcation of hominids on the border of the middle and upper paleolithic creativity allowed hs to design the adaptive forms of purposeful behavior corresponding to the conditions and the degree of uncertainty and create stable mental constructs in the absence of perceptual sources that do not require reactive behavior visualization of a target image which originally had an applied and instructional value in the process of semantic filling was transformed into a symbol which getting the qualities of the perceptual source loses its connection to the primary value and initiates the creation of qualitatively new needs for hominids: bilateral direct and inverse relations in the system subjectsymbol the ability to produce the prognostic hypothesis with expansion of the operating range of the hs mind allowed the ability to search and change the tactics of an adaptive behavior which gave the results: improvements in quality of life and an increase in life expectancy genetically fixed ; domination in intra and interspecific competition; the emergence of new operating systems of the psyche including the emergence and development of symbolic thought as a criterion of creativity with the potential ability for quantitative measurement we propose the value of deviation of creative oscillations proposal of a creative individual from the boundaries between stereotypes: for the cognition sphere a deviation from the border between recognizable and unrecognizable; for the social sphere between acceptable and unacceptable
this paper will show the correlation between the shear tensile test and the direct shear test within the field of geosynthetic clay liners gas it will be proven that the former may serve as a substitute for the latter but only for the adhesion value gcls are clay mineral sealing layers widespread used they can be used in waste and contaminated soil caps and closures landfill base liners gas and vapor seals vertical barriers etc gcls often have bentonite encased between two geotextile layers connected by fibers either by needlepunching or stitchbonding the results from peel tests and shear box tests are currently used for establishing the internal shear failure of gcls this paper analyzes the mechanical shear behavior of needlepunched gcls np gcls in a zero stress condition on the one hand a large direct shear test astm 624309 on np gcls specimens was used to study its shear behavior specifically assessing the adhesion value on the other hand the shear tensile test showed by maubeuge and ehrenberg maubeuge kp ehrenberg h 2000 comparison of peel bond and shear tensile test methods for needlepunched geosynthetic clay liners geotextiles and geomembranes 18 24 203214 was used to study the shear tensile strength comparing both test methods an average shear tensile value of 32 kpa was obtained which is closer to the average adhesion value of 30 kpa the dominant failure mechanisms are not depending on the test conditions eg dry or hydrated conditions however it strongly depends on the type of carrier geotextiles and their connections c 2013 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the primate prefrontal cortex represents both past and future goals to investigate its role in representing the goals of other agents we designed a nonmatchtogoal task that involved a humanmonkey hm interaction during each trial 2 of 4 potential goal objects were presented randomly to the left or right part of a display screen and the monkey's or human's task was to choose the one that did not match the object goal previously chosen human and monkey trials were intermixed and each agent when acting as observer was required to monitor the other actor's choice to switch the object goal choice in case it became the actor on the subsequent trial we found neurons encoding the actor either the monkey itself or the human neurons encoding the agent future goal position and neurons encoding the agent previous goal position in the category of neurons encoding the human future goal we differentiated between those encoding the future goal of both agents and those encoding only the human agent future goal while the first one might represent a covert mental simulation in the human trials the other one could represent a prediction signal of the other's agent choice

referring to two recent publications we here propose that clinical reproductive immunology has for decades stagnated because reproductive medicine including assisted reproduction ar has failed to accept embryo implantation as an immune systemdriven process dependent on establishment of maternal tolerance toward the implanting fetal semiallograft and complete allograft in cases of oocyte donation pregnancy represents a biologically unique period of temporary to the period of gestation restricted tolerance otherwise only known in association with parasitic infections rather than investigating the immune pathways necessary to induce this rather unique state of tolerance toward the rapidly growing parasitic antigen load of the fetus the field instead concentrated on irrelevant secondary immune phenomena ie immunological noise it therefore does not surprise that interesting recent research offering new potential insights into maternal tolerance during pregnancy was mostly published outside of the field of reproductive medicine this research offers evidence for existence of inducible maternal tolerance pathways with the ability of improving maternal fecundity and potentially reducing such late pregnancy complications as premature labor and preeclampsia/eclampsia due to premature abatement of maternal tolerance increasing evidence also suggests that toleranceinducing immune pathways are similar in successful pregnancy successful organ transplantation and likely also in the tolerance of self ie prevention of autoimmunity identifying and isolating these pathways therefore may greatly benefit all three of these clinical areas and research in reproductive immunology should be accordingly redirected

we construct teamoptimal estimation algorithms over distributed networks for state estimation in the finitehorizon meansquare error mse sense here we have a distributed collection of agents with processing and cooperation capabilities these agents observe noisy samples of a desired state through a linear model and seek to learn this state by interacting with each other although this problem has attracted significant attention and been studied extensively in fields including machine learning and signal processing all the wellknown strategies do not achieve teamoptimal learning performance in the finitehorizon mse sense to this end we formulate the finitehorizon distributed minimum mse mmse when there is no restriction on the size of the disclosed information ie oracle performance over an arbitrary network topology subsequently we show that exchange of local estimates is sufficient to achieve the oracle performance only over certain network topologies by inspecting these network structures we propose recursive algorithms achieving the oracle performance through the disclosure of local estimates for practical implementations we also provide approaches to reduce the complexity of the algorithms through the timewindowing of the observations finally in the numerical examples we demonstrate the superior performance of the introduced algorithms in the finitehorizon mse sense due to optimal estimation c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved

reinforcements can change the mechanical characteristics and liquefaction resistance of soils the main purpose of this study is to realise the behaviour of static liquefaction of saturated silty sand reinforced by different arrangements of geotextile layers several series of undrained triaxial tests were conducted on reinforced and unreinforced saturated sand and sand mixed with varying amounts of silt 050% factors such as the silt content arrangement and number of geotextile layers are discussed in this paper the results indicate that by increasing the silt content up to about 35% the static liquefaction resistance decreases in reinforced and unreinforced silty sand with further increases in silt content from 35 to 50% the liquefaction resistance increases also it was found that geotextile inclusion increases the liquefaction resistance of saturated sand for all silt contents examined the results of this study are limited to the use of sand and silty sand reinforced with one type of nonwoven geotextile
for decades developing hematopoietic cells have been strictly compartmentalized into a small population of multipotent selfrenewing hematopoietic stem cells multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells that are undergoing commitment to myeloid or lymphoid fates and unipotent precursor cells that mature towards peripheral blood and immune cells recent studies however have provided a battery of findings that cannot be explained by this classical hierarchical model for the architecture of hematopoiesis it is emerging that heterogeneous hematopoietic stem cell populations in the bone marrow coexist each with distinct preprogrammed differentiation and proliferation behaviors three subsets can be distinguished among them: myeloidbiased alpha balanced beta and lymphoidbiased gamma/delta hematopoietic stem cells the ratio of these hematopoietic stem cell subsets is developmentally regulated in the foetal liver and hematopoietic stem cells adult bone marrow and coordinately gives rise to hematopoiesis beta and gamma/deltahematopoietic stem cells are found predominantly early in the life of an organism whereas ahematopoietic stem cells accumulate in aged mice and humans in addition new sophisticated genetic experiments in mice have identified a major role of longlived committed progenitor cells downstream from hematopoietic stem cells as drivers of normal adult hematopoiesis and revealed that posttransplantation hematopoiesis differs qualitatively and quantitatively from normal steadystate hematopoiesis these findings have important implications for understanding in situ the regulation of haematopoiesis in health and disease
partisanship increasingly factors into the behavior of americans in both political and nonpolitical situations yet the bounds of partisan prejudice are largely unknown in this paper we systematically evaluate the limits of partisan prejudice using a series of five studies situated within a typology of prejudice we find that partisan prejudice predicts suppression of hostile rhetoric toward one's own party avoidance of members of the opposition and a desire for preferential treatment for one's own party while these behaviors may cause incidental or indirect harm to the opposition we find that even the most affectively polarizedthose with the strongest disdain for the oppositionare no more likely to intentionally harm the opposition than those with minimal levels of affective polarization
generativity contributing to the next generation is important for wellbeing throughout middle and late life therefore it is crucial to understand what contributes to generativity during these life stages parenting and work are common but not the only ways people engage generatively; prosocial behavior is another a community connection may encourage generative contributions in adults however older adults may face obstacles to being generative and may need an additional drive to engage in these behaviors given this it was expected that community cohesion would predict prosocial behavior despite age and that grit would provide motivation for older adults so the current study examined whether age moderated the relation between grit and prosocial behavior data were used from 188 uppermidwest adults aged 3789 multiple regression analyses showed that age moderated the relation between grit and prosocial behavior such that grit predicted prosocial behavior in older adults but not middle age adults a sense of community cohesion was predictive of prosocial behavior despite age while grit may promote generative acts in different ways depending on age a sense of community cohesion may foster community contributions despite age the discussion focuses on future directions and ways to promote generativity using this research c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

the ability to rapidly detect and characterize drug metabolites in biological fluids often relies on a combination of a high quality chromatographic separation and sensitive high resolution mass spectrometry here the performance of two high throughput lc/ms approaches namely monolith columns and sub2 mu m particle ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc columns is compared for the detection and identification of the human metabolites of acetaminophen in urine the uplc system produced approximately three times the sensitivity and detected more metabolites than the monolithic column approach the sharp peaks produced by uplc seem to be particularly advantageous when coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry apparently reducing ion suppression leading to superior sensitivity and hence lower limits of detection c 2005 elsevier bv all rights reserved
due to the edgepreserving ability the bilateral filter is considered as the fundamental tool in computer vision and computer graphics however its computational complexity has a close connection with the size of the box window this drawback leads that the bilateral filter is inappropriate for the computational insensitive application one way to accelerate the bilateral filter is to approximate the gaussian range kernel by trigonometric functions and synthesise final results from a set of filtering results of fast convolutions a novel approximation that can be applied to any range kernel is proposed specifically first the z transformation of the range kernel is obtained then approximate the z transformation of the range kernel using the pade approximation finally inverse the transformation of the pade approximation and obtain an exponential sum to approximate original range kernel where the coefficients of the exponential basis are computed by solving a set of linear equations experiments show the method achieves stateoftheart results in terms of accuracy and speed

this study develops a general analytical model for describing transient drawdown distribution induced by pumping at a finiteradius well in a radial twozone confined aquifer of finite areal extent with robintype condition at both inner and outer boundaries this model is also applicable to heat conduction problems for a composite hollow cylinder on the basis of the analogy between heat flow and groundwater flow the timedomain solution of the model is derived by the methods of laplace transform bromwich integral and residue theorem this new solution can reduce to the solution for constanthead test cht or constantrate test crt problem by specifying appropriate coefficients at the robin inner boundary condition the solution describing the flow rate across the wellbore due to cht is further developed by applying darcy's law to the new solution in addition steadystate solutions for both cht and crt are also developed based on the approximation for bessel functions with very small argument values many existing solutions for transient flow in homogeneous or twozone finite aquifers with dirichlet or noflow condition at the outer boundary are shown to be special cases of the present solution furthermore the sensitivity analysis is also performed to investigate the behaviors of the wellbore flow due to cht and the aquifer drawdown induced by crt in response to the change in each of aquifer parameters c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
nmethyldaspartate receptors nmdars are major targets of both acute and chronic alcohol as well as regulators of plasticity in a number of brain regions aberrant plasticity may contribute to the treatment resistance and high relapse rates observed in alcoholics recent work suggests that chronic alcohol treatment preferentially modulates both the expression and subcellular localization of nmdars containing the glun2b subunit signaling through synaptic and extrasynaptic glun2bnmdars has already been implicated in the pathophysiology of various other neurological disorders nmdars interact with a large number of proteins at the glutamate synapse and a better understanding of how alcohol modulates this proteome is needed we employed a discoverybased proteomic approach in subcellular fractions of hippocampal tissue from chronic intermittent alcohol cie exposed c57bl/6j mice to gain insight into alcoholinduced changes in glun2b signaling complexes protein enrichment analyses revealed changes in the association of postsynaptic proteins including scaffolding glutamate receptor and pdzdomain binding proteins with glun2b in particular glun2b interaction with metabotropic glutamate mglu 1/5 receptordependent longterm depression ltd associated proteins such as arc and homer 1 was increased while glua2 was decreased accordingly we found a lack of mglu 1/5 induced ltd while 1 adrenergic receptorinduced ltd remained intact in hippocampal ca1 following cie these data suggest that cie specifically disrupts mglu 1/5 ltd representing a possible connection between nmdar and mglu receptor signaling these studies not only demonstrate a new way in which alcohol can modulate plasticity in the hippocampus but also emphasize the utility of this discoverybased proteomic approach to generate new hypotheses regarding alcoholrelated mechanisms
threedimensional symmetric tensor fields have a wide range of applications in solid and fluid mechanics recent advances in the topological analysis of 3d symmetric tensor fields focus on degenerate tensors which form curves in this paper we introduce a number of feature surfaces such as neutral surfaces and traceless surfaces into tensor field analysis based on the notion of eigenvalue manifold neutral surfaces are the boundary between linear tensors and planar tensors and the traceless surfaces are the boundary between tensors of positive traces and those of negative traces degenerate curves neutral surfaces and traceless surfaces together form a partition of the eigenvalue manifold which provides a more complete tensor field analysis than degenerate curves alone we also extract and visualize the isosurfaces of tensor modes tensor isotropy and tensor magnitude which we have found useful for domain applications in fluid and solid mechanics extracting neutral and traceless surfaces using the marching tetrahedra method can cause the loss of geometric and topological details which can lead to false physical interpretation to robustly extract neutral surfaces and traceless surfaces we develop a polynomial description of them which enables us to borrow techniques from algebraic surface extraction a topic wellresearched by the computeraided design cad community as well as the algebraic geometry community in addition we adapt the surface extraction technique called apatches to improve the speed of finding degenerate curves finally we apply our analysis to data from solid and fluid mechanics as well as scalar field analysis
a pilot study was conducted for human biomonitoring of the suspected carcinogen 2chloroprene for this purpose urine samples of 14 individuals occupationally exposed to 2chloroprene exposed group and of 30 individuals without occupational exposure to alkylating substances control group were analysed for six potential mercapturic acids of 2chloroprene: 4chloro3oxobutyl mercapturic acid clmai 4chloro3hydroxybutyl mercapturic acid clmaii 3chloro2hydroxy3butenyl mercapturic acid clmaiii 4hydroxy3oxobutyl mercapturic acid hobma 3 4dihydroxybutyl mercapturic acid dhbma and 2hydroxy3butenyl mercapturic acid mhbma in direct comparison with the control group elevated levels of the mercapturic acids clmaiii mhbma hobma and dhbma were found in the urine samples of the exposed group clmai and clmaii were not detected in any of the samples whereas hobma and dhbma were found in all analysed urine samples thus for the first time it was possible to detect hobma and clmaiii in human urine the mercapturic acid clmaiii could be confirmed as a specific metabolite of 2chloroprene in humans providing evidence for the intermediate formation of a reactive epoxide during biotransformation the main metabolite however was found to be dhbma showing a distinct and significant correlation with the urinary clmaiii levels in the exposed group the obtained results give new scientific insight into the course of biotransformation of 2chloroprene in humans

experimental studies find a strong influence of nonverbal signals on the evaluation of political candidates when raters are asked to judge unknown candidates from shortduration exposures yet when viewers are exposed to candidates' verbal and nonverbal communication in a more naturally occurring context the presence of verbal communication can make the influence of nonverbal communication seem attenuated to link these findings the present study uses continuous response measurement to uncover the relative influence of verbal and nonverbal communication on political opinion formation during a debate clip lasting about 9 minutes the analysis suggests that nonverbal communication influences candidate evaluations especially during the beginning of the presentation verbal communication seems influential for the remaining time consistent with this trend study participants' postexposure opinions were influenced by both verbal and nonverbal communication

5g mobile networks are promising to offer mobile users unrivaled experiences with infinite networking capability at any period and from anywhere however it appears unnecessary and impractical for the customers and servers to be connected permanently in wireless networks because battery life is a bottleneck in such kind of networks therefore the authorized entity needs to delegate its right to others in order to ensure the services available this paper aims to address the issue of delegating authentication in 5g networks by proposing a new proxy signature scheme with efficient proxy signing operations concretely we present a new and efficient proxy signature algorithm whose unforgeability can be reduced to the wellknown discrete logarithm assumption in the proposal the original signer delegates his signing right by signing an exposurefree chameleon hash value on the warrant and the proxy signer can generate a proxy signature on a message only by calculating a chameleon hash collision between the warrant and the message this approach is computationally costeffective for the proxy signer further analysis of the new scheme demonstrates that it offers the desirable properties of delegation of signing sights copyright c 2015 john wiley & sons ltd
alzheimer's disease ad has been associated with magnesium ion mg2+ deficits and interleukin1 beta il1 beta elevations in the serum or brains of ad patients however the mechanisms regulating il1 beta expression during mg 2+ dyshomeostasis in ad remain unknown we herein studied the mechanism of il1 beta reduction using a recently developed compound magnesiumlthreonate mgt using human glioblastoma a172 and mouse brain d1a glial cells as an in vitro model system we delineated the signaling pathways by which mgt suppressed the expression of il1 beta in glial cells in detail we found that mgt incubation stimulated the activity of extracellular signalregulated protein kinases 1 and 2 erk1/2 and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma ppar gamma signaling pathways by phosphorylation which resulted in il1 beta suppression simultaneous inhibition of the phosphorylation of erk1/2 and ppar gamma induced il1 beta upregulation in mgtstimulated glial cells in accordance with our in vitro data the intracerebroventricular icv injection of mgt into the ventricles of app/ps1 transgenic mice and treatment of ab precursor protein app /ps1 brain slices suppressed the mrna and protein expression of il1 beta these in vivo observations were further supported by the oral administration of mgt for 5 months importantly mg 2+ influx into the ventricles of the mice blocked the effects of il1 beta or amyloid betaprotein oligomers in the cerebrospinal fluid this reduced the stimulation of il1 beta expression in the cerebral cortex of app/ps1 transgenic mice which potentially contributed to the inhibition of neuroinflammation cellular & molecular immunology 2017 published online 9 november 2015
attention biases to sleeprelated stimuli are held to play a key role in the development and maintenance of insomnia but such biases have only been shown with controlled visual displays this study investigated whether observers with insomnia symptoms allocate attention to sleeprelated items in natural scenes by recording eye movements during freeviewing of bedrooms participants with insomnia symptoms and normal sleepers were matched in their visual exploration of these scenes and there was no evidence that the attention of those with insomnia symptoms was captured more quickly by sleep related stimuli than that of normal sleepers however the insomnia group fixated bed regions on more trials and once fixated on a bed also remained there for longer these findings indicate that sleep stimuli are particularly effective in retaining visual attention in complex natural scenes c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
caring is a positive social act but can it result in negative attitudes towards those cared for and towards others from their wider social group? based on intergroup contact theory we tested whether care workers' cws positive and negative contact with oldage care home residents chrs predicts prejudiced attitudes towards that group and whether this generalises to other older people fiftysix cws were surveyed about their positive and negative contact with chrs and their blatant and subtle attitudes humanness attributions towards chrs and older adults we tested indirect paths from contact with chrs to attitudes towards older adults via attitudes towards chrs results showed that neither positive nor negative contact generalised blatant ageism however the effect of negative but not positive contact on the denial of humanness to chrs generalised to subtle ageism towards older adults this evidence has practical implications for management of cws' work experiences and theoretical implications suggesting that negative contact with a subgroup generalises the attribution of humanness to superordinate groups because it is difficult to identify and challenge subtle prejudices such as dehumanisation it may be especially important to reduce negative contact c 2016 the authors journal of community & applied social psychology published by john wiley & sons ltd

cancer cell metabolism is a complex dynamic network of regulated pathways interrogation of this network would benefit from rapid sensitive techniques that are adaptable to highthroughput formats facilitating novel compound screening this requires assays that have minimal sample preparation and are adaptable to lowervolume 384well formats and automation here we describe bioluminescent glucose lactate glutamine and glutamate detection assays that are well suited for highthroughput analysis of two major metabolic pathways in cancer cells: glycolysis and glutaminolysis the sensitivity 15 pmol/sample broad linear range 01100 mu m and wide dynamic range >100fold are advantageous for measuring both extracellular and intracellular metabolites importantly the assays incorporate rapid inactivation of endogenous enzymes eliminating deproteinization steps required by other methods using ovarian cancer cell lines as a model system the assays were used to monitor changes in glucose and glutamine consumption and lactate and glutamate secretion over time homogeneous formats of the lactate and glutamate assays were robust z' 0609 and could be multiplexed with a realtime viability assay to generate internally controlled data screening a smallcompound library with these assays resulted in the identification of both inhibitors and activators of lactate and glutamate production
the problem of interregional interchange scheduling in the presence of stochastic generation and load is considered an interchange scheduling technique based on a twostage stochastic minimization of expected operating cost is proposed because directly solving the stochastic optimization is intractable an equivalent problem that maximizes the expected social welfare is formulated the proposed technique leverages the operator's capability of forecasting locational marginal prices and obtains the optimal interchange schedule without iterations among operators several extensions of the proposed technique are also discussed
landsat data are increasingly used for ecological monitoring and research these data often require preprocessing prior to analysis to account for sensor solar atmospheric and topographic effects however ecologists using these data are faced with a literature containing inconsistent terminology outdated methods and a vast number of approaches with contradictory recommendations these issues can at best make determining the correct preprocessing workflow a difficult and timeconsuming task and at worst lead to erroneous results we address these problems by providing a concise overview of the landsat missions and sensors and by clarifying frequently conflated terms and methods preprocessing steps commonly applied to landsat data are differentiated and explained including georeferencing and coregistration conversion to radiance solar correction atmospheric correction topographic correction and relative correction we then synthesize this information by presenting workflows and a decision tree for determining the appropriate level of imagery preprocessing given an ecological research question while emphasizing the need to tailor each workflow to the study site and question at hand we recommend a parsimonious approach to landsat preprocessing that avoids unnecessary steps and recommend approaches and data products that are well tested easily available and sufficiently documented our focus is specific to ecological applications of landsat data yet many of the concepts and recommendations discussed are also appropriate for other disciplines and remote sensing platforms

this paper presents the stability analysis of dc distributed power systems with multiple convertercontrolled loads the load converters are tightly controlled behaving as constant power loads with lowdamped lc filters the dynamic behavior of the system in high frequency range is often not studied with the classical tools based on conventional averaging techniques however dc power systems with the reduced size filter and consequently the high resonant frequency are widely used in transportation applications in this paper the stability analysis of the system is established based on a discretetime model of the system taking into account the switching frequency and intrinsic nonlinearities of the system model the impacts of the filter parameters and interactions among the constant power loads are investigated with the proposed discretetime method moreover an active stabilizer is developed and included in the dynamic model of the system in order to extend the stability margin the theoretical observations are then validated experimentally on a laboratory hardware prototype
harnessing the immune system to fight cancer is an exciting advancement in lung cancer therapy antitumor immunity can be augmented by checkpoint blockade therapy which removes the inhibition/brakes imposed on the immune system by the tumor checkpoint blockade therapy with antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 antipd1 /antiprogrammed death ligand 1 antipdl1 antibodies causes tumor regression in about 25% of patients with lung cancer in another approach the immune system is forced or accelerated to attack the tumor through augmentation of the antitumor response against mutations carried by each lung tumor this latter approach has become feasible since the advent of nextgeneration sequencing technology which allows identification of the specific mutations that each individual lung tumor bears indeed lung cancers are now known to have high mutation rates making them logical targets for mutationdirected immune therapies we review how sequencing of lung cancer mutations leads to better understanding of how the immune system recognizes tumors providing improved opportunities to track antitumor immunity and ultimately leading to the development of personalized vaccine strategies aimed at unleashing the host immune system to attack mutations in the tumor
with the fully mature and a vast number of available virtualization solutions there is an uptake in creating the opportunity for remote and/or virtual laboratories to either supplement or fully replace physical networking laboratories our approach focuses on nodes rather than environments hosting the nodes the paper addresses setting up virtual laboratories made of widely available general purpose operating systems based on linux that act as a network operating system we discuss several software defined networking solutions and lay out the configuration setup for virtual laboratories we evaluate them by the opportunity they provide in the context of learning and a potential experience we conclude with an observation that with an increasing number of linux based network operating systems management of network forwarding devices becomes management of servers which leads to the unification of the cloud fabric

although research has shown that interventions within educational contexts based on direct facetoface contact are effective in reducing prejudice they may be difficult to implement recent research has demonstrated that also indirect contact is a useful strategy to improve intergroup relations in the present work we focus on three forms of indirect contact which have received consistent attention by social psychologists in recent years: vicarious contact extended contact imagined contact the interventions reviewed support indirect contact strategies as effective and flexible means of reducing prejudice within schools in the final part of the article we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our literature review and provide some suggestions for future research
a citizen science approach was implemented in the laboratory practices of genetics at the university of oviedo related with the engaging topic of food control real samples of food products consumed by students at home students as samplers were employed as teaching material in three different courses of genetics during the academic year 20142015: experimental methods in food production mbta master level and applied molecular biology bma and conservation genetics and breeding comge bachelor/degree level molecular genetics based on pcr amplification of dna markers was employed for species identification of 22 seafood products in comge and mbta and for detection of genetically modified gm maize from nine products in bma in total six seafood products incorrectly labeled 27% and two undeclared gm maize 22% were found a postlaboratory survey was applied for assessing the efficacy of the approach for improving motivation in the laboratory practices of genetics results confirmed that students that worked on their own samples from local markets were significantly more motivated and better evaluated their genetic laboratory practices than control students chi 2 1211 p0033 our results suggest that citizen science approaches could not be only useful for improving teaching of genetics in universities but also to incorporate students and citizens as active agents in food control c 2016 by the international union of biochemistry and molecular biology
nanoscale biosensors owing to their highsensitivity and extremely low limitsofdetection have enabled the realization of highly complex and sophisticated miniaturized platforms for several important healthcare applications the most predominant one being disease diagnosis in particular nanomaterial facilitated electrochemical detection of dna hybridization has had an exceptional impact on fields such as genetics and cancerous mutation detection here we report an ultrasensitive electrochemical platform using electrospun semiconducting manganese iii oxide mn2o3 nanofibers for dna hybridization detection the proposed platform coalesces the inherent advantages of metaloxide nanofibers and electrochemical transduction techniques resulting in labelfree zeptomolar detection of dna hybridization as proof of concept we demonstrate zeptomolar detection of dengue consensus primer limit of detection: 120x10 21 m both in control as well as spiked serum samples our reported detection limit is superior in comparison with previously reported electrochemical dna hybridization sensors for dengue virus detection spanning both labeled and labelfree transductions this ultrasensitivity we believe is a result of synthesizing a low bandgap electrospun metaloxide nanomaterial corresponding to a specific oxidation state of manganese this methodology can be extended for detection of any hybridization of interest by simply adapting an appropriate functionalization protocol and thus is very generic in nature
ankylosing spondylitis as is an autoimmune disease with a chronic inflammatory arthritis the critical role of methylation in the biology of immunocytes has increasingly been surveyed to discover disease etiology dna methyltransferase 1 dnmt1 is an enzyme which establishes and regulates patterns of methylated cytosine residues the aim of the current investigation was to unveil if methylation circumstances of cpg sites in dnmt1 promoter could affect the mrna expression level of this gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from as patients pbmcs were isolated from whole blood of 40 as patients and 40 healthy individuals total rna and dna contents of leukocytes were extracted afterward quantitative analysis was carried out by realtime pcr using the sybr green pcr master mix finally to determine the methylation level pcr products of bisulfitetreated dna from patients and controls were sequenced compared with healthy controls expression level of dnmt1 in as patients was significantly downregulated methylation of dnmt1 promoter was significantly higher in as patients in comparison to controls while a negative correlation between methylation and expression level of dnmt1 was observed in as patients both methylation and expression level of dnmt1 did not correlate with clinical manifestations considering the observation that decreased expression level of dnmt1 was associated with hypermethylation of dnmt1 promoter in pbmcs from as patients this survey suggests that dysregulation of dnmt1 expression through altered methylation level of other target genes would probably contribute to as development

this study presents the importance of disconnectivity in dryland area runoff demonstrated by manmade water harvesting structures dated to grecoroman times located on the coastal strip of some 20 km width along the mediterranean coast of modern northwestern egypt covering the northeastern part of the region known in antiquity as marmarica the area receives winterly rainfalls of up to 140 mm further south precipitation decreases quickly and desert conditions become more pronounced bedrocks are predominantly calcareous soils are loamy stony calcareous and shallow except in relief sinks with sedimentary deposits the land rises from the coast up to 230 masl on the marmarica plateau in a sequence of zonal northsloping plains and scarps the northern parts of which are dissected and drained by wadis agriculturally suitable areas comprise some 9% of the coastal zone and adjacent tablelands overland flow controls the discharge dynamics and is the main source of wadi runoff and hence agricultural water supply the land use pattern is scattered because cropping areas depend mainly on suitability of soils and the generation of runoff harvest which are closely interrelated because of the arid water and sediment regime the patchiness of runoff generation increases further south where aridity is higher and topography inhibits greater drainage patterns the abundance of cisterns many of them originally grecoroman is strong evidence that tableland overland flows occur and are frequently disconnected from larger drainage systems abandoned ancient rainwater harvesting and watershed management systems are abundant all over the region and incorporate the hydrological experience of the former inhabitants having been dated with osl and pottery mainly from grecoroman times while the region prospered some two millenia ago the ancient water management schemes are generally abandoned today one of the most outstanding features of the ancient systems was the systematic harvesting of tableland and valley slope overland flow above the wadi beds part of this strategy was to separate the remote parts of large natural watersheds from the local parts by shallow stone bunds on the tableland the collected tableland overland flow irrigated terraced fields on the tableland lairum the remaining water harvesting areas mainly valley slopes were obviously sufficient to supply water for small tributary wadis large side terraces and the floodplains of large wadis the artificial disconnection of local runoff areas from remote parts of the northern watersheds is hydrologically well adapted to the runoff dynamics in the flat landscape of the northern marmarica because it protected valleys from low frequency high magnitude runoff events which are generated mainly on the remote parts of large catchments but which are inefficient in terms of water harvesting terracing and water harvesting structures are frequently buried in wellsorted finegrained sediment c 2013 elsevier bv all rights reserved
human parvovirus b19 b19 is harmful during pregnancy since it can be vertically transmitted to the developing fetus in addition the antib19 antibodies induced by b19 infection are believed to have a cytopathic role in b19 transmission; however knowledge regarding the effects of antib19 antibodies during pregnancy is limited to investigate the possible roles of antib19 antibodies during pregnancy the present study examined the effects of antib19vp1 unique region vp1u antib19vp2 and antib19nonstructural protein 1 ns1 immunoglobulin g igg antibodies on bewo trophoblasts briefly bewo trophoblasts were incubated with purified igg against b19vp1u b19vp2 and b19ns1 subsequently the expression of surface proteins and apoptotic molecules were assessed in bewo trophoblasts using flow cytometry elisa and western blotting the expression levels of human leukocyte antigen hla g were significantly increased on bewo trophoblasts treated with rabbit antib19vp1u igg and were unchanged in those treated with rabbit antib19ns1 and antib19vp2 igg as compared with the control group furthermore the expression levels of globoside p blood group antigen and cluster of differentiation cd 29 beta 1 integrin were significantly increased in bewo trophoblasts treated with rabbit antib19ns1 and antib19vp2 igg whereas only cd29 was also significantly increased in cells treated with antib19vp1u igg in addition the number of cells at subg 1 phase; caspase3 activity; and the expression of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic molecules including fasassociated death domain protein activated caspase8 activated caspase3 bcell lymphoma 2associated x protein cytochrome c apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 and activated caspase9 were significantly increased in bewo trophoblasts treated with antib19vp1u and antib19ns1 igg in conclusion the present study demonstrated that antibodies against b19 may have a crucial role in pathological processes during pregnancy these findings may help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying transmission of the b19 virus during pregnancy
actuators for more electric aircraft are predominantly based on permanent magnet machines for the best power to weight ratio however permanent magnet machines can give rise to drag torque under short circuit conditions this paper explains the concept of permanent magnet assistance in switched reluctance machines and sets out a topology which maximizes the benefits of permanent magnet assistance without compromising fault tolerance the problem of demagnetization in this topology is explored and a revised design proposed the increased torque from permanent magnet assistance is demonstrated and laboratory tests on a prototype machine evidence the fault tolerant nature of the proposed machine by comparison with a baseline permanent magnet machine design it is suggested that the permanent magnet assisted segmental rotor switched reluctance machine could achieve similar torque to a permanent magnet machine in this application with much improved fault tolerance and with much reduced magnet mass

there is a growing consensus that a fuller understanding of social cognition depends on more systematic studies of realtime social interaction such studies require methods that can deal with the complex dynamics taking place at multiple interdependent temporal and spatial scales spanning subpersonal personal and dyadic levels of analysis we demonstrate the value of adopting an extended multiscale approach by reanalyzing movement timeseries generated in a study of embodied dyadic interaction in a minimal virtual reality environment a perceptual crossing experiment reduced movement variability revealed an interdependence between social awareness and social coordination that cannot be accounted for by either subjective or objective factors alone: it picks out interactions in which subjective and objective conditions are convergent ie elevated coordination is perceived as clearly social and impaired coordination is perceived as socially ambiguous this finding is consistent with the claim that interpersonal interaction can be partially constitutive of direct social perception clustering statistics allan factor of salient events revealed fractal scaling complexity matching defined as the similarity between these scaling laws was significantly more pronounced in pairs of participants as compared to surrogate dyads this further highlights the multiscale and distributed character of social interaction and extends previous complexity matching results from dyadic conversation to nonverbal social interaction dynamics trials with successful joint interaction were also associated with an increase in local coordination consequently a local coordination pattern emerges on the background of complex dyadic interactions in the pce task and makes joint successful performance possible
the collapse of drinking water management systems is one of the most serious consequences of natural disasters this article aims to analyze the vulnerability of drinking water management during and after a natural disaster in the rural and coastal areas of bangladesh we have considered the extreme event of cyclone 'aila' which devastated the coastal district of satkhira in 2009 in the study area the collection of drinking water in normal situations is difficult mainly because of the spatially varied availability of drinking water sources tube wells ponds and rainwater harvesting units in addition the decreasing trend in premonsoon rainfall intensity as well as the increased salinity play a significant role in this regard due to the destruction of the coastal embankment during cyclone 'aila' saltwater intruded into the locality and heavily damaged the drinking water sources to analyze the associated vulnerability factors in the drinking water sector we conducted a householdbased structured questionnaire survey in three 'mouza' revenue collection unit of the satkhira district using principal component analysis we have identified six factors influencing drinking water vulnerability the factors are related to warning dissemination damage to water sources damage to household's water reserves collection time family composition and frequency of water collection we have used the factors to prepare an index for the comparative analysis of vulnerability among the three 'mouza' considering the vulnerability issues the article concludes by presenting the scope for a robust drinking water management plan for the coastal areas of bangladesh c 2015 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
this paper presents a modified design approach as well as a practical and effective neural network efficiency estimation procedure of a permanent capacitor singlephase induction motor spim the standard industrial motor frame sizes along with the current design trends of larger lengths and smaller diameters are taken into account which are not likely presented in literature in this context a computeraided design approach of a spim based mainly on the classical output coefficient is proposed first numerous simulations using finite elements method fem are conducted in order to verify the proposed procedure and investigations regarding the number of stator and rotor slots are performed secondly based on the previous results a neural network nn scheme is proposed in order to estimate the efficiency of spims with various stator/rotor slots combinations and different output power it is seen that the proposed methodology is verified satisfactorily and could be of great use as an aid tool to industrial spim designers

much is known about when children acquire an understanding of mental states but few if any experiments identify social contexts in which children tend to use this capacity and dispositions that influence its usage social exclusion is a common situation that compels us to reconnect with new parties which may crucially involve attending to those parties' mental states across two studies this line of inquiry was extended to typically developing preschoolers study 1 and young children with and without anxiety disorder ad study 2 children played the virtual game of toss cyberball ostensibly over the internet with two peers who first played fair inclusion but eventually threw very few balls to the child exclusion before and after cyberball children in both studies completed stories about peerscenarios for study 1 36 typically developing 5yearolds were randomly assigned to regular exclusion for no apparent reason or accidental exclusion due to an alleged computer malfunction compared to accidental exclusion regular exclusion led children to portray storycharacters more strongly as intentional agents intentionality with use of more mental state language msl and more betweencharacter affiliation in postcyberball stories for study 2 20 clinically referred 4 to 8yearolds with ad and 15 age and gendermatched nonanxious controls completed stories before and after regular exclusion while we replicated the post regularexclusion increase of intentional and msl portrayals of storycharacters among nonanxious controls anxious children exhibited a decline on both dimensions after regular exclusion we conclude that exclusion typically induces young children to mentalize enabling more effective reconnection with others however excessive anxiety may impair controlled mentalizing which may in turn hamper effective reconnection with others after exclusion
individual differences in early attention are associated with later social cognitive and emotional development and attentional deficits in the first year are associated with risk for developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder asd the first year inventory fyi; baranek watson crais & reznick 2003 was developed to identify 12montholds at risk for an asd diagnosis the current study identifies fyi items that reflect aspects of early attention that might predict future typical and atypical social cognitive and emotional development using a series of theoretical and statistical methods we developed 3 attentionbased constructs from the fyi: responding to social attention rsa initiating social attention isa and nonsocial sensory attention nsa a database with completed fyis was analyzed using these constructs to determine the strength of relations among items cronbach's alpha analyses indicated good internal consistency and item distribution was further supported using a confirmatory factor analysis data analyses showed statistically significant relations between the scores on these domains at 12 months and subsequent social responsiveness scores at 3 years analyses demonstrating the statistical and predictive validity of these 3 fyi attention constructs support their use for innovative explorations of infant behavioral patterns that can be used to predict typical and atypical individual trajectories in the development of later social cognitive and emotional skills
background: advances in the nucleic acid sequencing technologies have ushered in the era of geneticbased precision medicine applications of the genetic discoveries to practice of medicine however are hindered by phenotypic variability of the genetic variants the report illustrates extreme pleiotropic phenotypes associated with an established causal mutation for hereditary cardiomyopathy case presentation: we report a 61year old white female who presented with syncope and echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance cmr imaging findings consistent with the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy hcm the electrocardiogram however showed a qrs pattern resembling an epsilon wave a feature of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy arvc whole exome sequencing mean depth of coverage of exons 178x analysis did not identify a pathogenic variant in the known hcm genes but identified an established causal mutation for arvc the mutation involves a canonical splice accepter site c21461g >c in the pkp2 gene which encodes plakophillin 2 sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation pkp2 is the most common causal gene for arvc but has not been implicated in hcm findings on echocardiography and cmr during the course of 4year follow up showed septal hypertrophy and a hyperdynamic left ventricle consistent with the diagnosis of hcm however neither baseline nor follow up echocardiography and cmr studies showed evidence of arvc the right ventricle was normal in size thickness and function and there was no evidence of fibrofatty infiltration in the myocardium conclusions: the patient carries an established pathogenic mutation for arvc and a subtle finding of arvc but exhibits the classic phenotype of hcm a contrasting phenotype to arvc the case illustrates the need for detailed phenotypic characterization for patients with hereditary cardiomyopathies as well as the challenges physicians face in applying the genetic discoveries in practicing geneticbased precision medicine
purpose of review altered differentiation and activation of tcell subsets occur in patients with chronic kidney disease ckd but the impact on graft rejection and protective immunity during transplantation are not fully understood recent findings patients with ckd have decreased frequency of naive t cells accumulation of activated terminally differentiated memory cells and skewed regulatory versus t helper 17 ratio naive and memory tcell subsets do not appear to improve following kidney transplantation retained thymic output is associated with acute rejection whereas naive lymphopenia and accumulation of cd8 + temra cells correlate with longterm graft dysfunction cd28 null memory cells accumulate during ckd and appear to confer protection against acute rejection under standard immunosuppression and possibly costimulation blockade t cells bearing cd57 are also increased in patients with ckd and may underlie rejection during costimulation blockade summary the mechanisms by which ckd alters the differentiation and activation status of tcell subsets is poorly understood further research is also needed to understand which cell populations mediate rejection under various immunosuppressive regimens to date there is little use of animal models of organ failure in transplant immunology research ckd mouse models may help identify novel pathways and targets to better control alloimmunity in posttransplant

reduced bone density and secondary osteoporosis resulting in increased risk of fracture is a significant complicating factor in the inflammatory arthritides while the exact etiology of systemic bone loss is not fully elucidated recent insights into the tumor necrosis factor super family tnfsf revealed a potential role for death receptor 3 dr3/tnfrsf25 and one of its ligands tnflike protein 1a tl1a/tnfsf15 the mechanisms by which dr3/tl1a signalling modulates bone loss are unclear we investigated the effect of dr3/111a signalling upon osteoclastdependent chemokine and mmp production to unravel novel mechanisms whereby this pathway regulates oc formation and ocdependent bone resorption collagen induced arthritis cia was established in dr3 wt and dr3 ko mice joints were sectioned and analysed histologically for bone damage while systemic trabecular bone loss distal to the affected joints was compared by microct ablation of dr3 protected dba/1 mice against the development and progression of cia in dr3 ko joints of the ankle and midfoot were almost free of bone erosions and long bones of mice with cia were protected against systemic trabecular bone loss in vitro expression of dr3 was confirmed on primary human cd14 + osteoclast precursors by flow cytometry these cells were treated with tl1a in osteoclast differentiation medium and trap + osteoclasts bone resorption levels of osteoclastassociated chemokines ccl3 ccl2 and cxcl8 and mmp9 measured tl1a intensified human osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption and increased osteoclastassociated production of ccl3 and mmp9 our data reveals the dr3 pathway as an attractive therapeutic target to combat adverse bone pathology associated with inflammatory arthritis we demonstrate that dr3 is critical in the pathogenesis of murine cia and associated secondary osteoporosis furthermore we identify a novel mechanism by which the dr3/111a pathway directly enhances human oc formation and resorptive activity controlling expression and activation of ccl3 and mmp9 c 2017 the authors published by elsevier inc
previous research has shown that hyperactivation in ventral medial prefrontal cortex vmpfc and rostral anterior cingulate cortex racc and high cortisol to corticotrophin ratio cort:acth ratio during neutralrelaxed states predict relapse in alcoholdependent ad patients other studies have shown that vmpfc/racc deactivation and blunted cortisol release to stress and alcohol cues are predictive of time to relapse and relapse severity however no previous study has assessed the relationship between these markers of central and peripheral nervous system dysfunction in ad participants and their potential joint effects on relapse risk forty early abstinent treatment engaged ad patients underwent a laboratory experiment with exposure to neutral alcohol and stress cues and a separate functional magnetic resonance imaging scan with similar cue exposure neutralrelaxed state cort:acth ratio was significantly associated with vmpfc hyperreactivity to neutralrelaxing cues and also with hypoactivation in response to alcohol and stress cues in ad patients basal heart rate neutral cort:acth ratio and neutral vmpfc hyperreactivty were each associated with risk of relapse however abnormal vmpfc activation and elevated cort:acth ratio overlap in predicting risk for relapse and dysfunctional vmpfc response was the sole significant predictor of odds of relapse in a joint model of relapse risk these findings suggest that the cort:acth ratio may serve as a peripheral marker of vmpfc brain dysfunction while aberrant vmpfc responses need further evaluation as a potential biomarker of alcohol relapse risk in clinical outcome studies

trees and their derivative products have been used by societies around the world for thousands of years contemporary construction of tall buildings from timber in whole or in part suggests a growing interest in the potential for building with wood at a scale not previously attainable as wood is the only significant building material that is grown we have a natural inclination that building in wood is good for the environment but under what conditions is this really the case? the environmental benefits of using timber are not straightforward; although it is a natural product a large amount of energy is used to dry and process it much of this can come from the biomass of the tree itself but that requires investment in plant which is not always possible in an industry that is widely distributed among many small producers and what should we build with wood? are skyscrapers in timber a good use of this natural resource or are there other aspects of civil and structural engineering or largescale infrastructure that would be a better use of wood? here we consider a holistic picture ranging in scale from the science of the cell wall to the engineering and global policies that could maximise forestry and timber construction as a boon to both people and the planet
a relatively new form of human communication videoconferencing has become more popular as video technology improves and with increasing demands for realtime communication across greater distances the full effects of videoconferencing on human communication are still being explored videoconferencing is presumed to be a somewhat richer form of communication than email and telephone but not quite as informative as facetoface communication this review explores research into the influence of eye contact on communication and how videoconferencing mediates both verbal and nonverbal interactions facilitation of eye contact is a challenge that must be addressed so that videoconferencing can approach the rich interactions of facetoface communication c 2012 elsevier bv all rights reserved
in this paper we focus on attacks based on sniffing like mitm and how to counter them from the network layer perspective we've already developed an algorithm called pathfinder that allows us to forward segments from same packets via different paths doing so we'll ensure that an attacker will not be able to get hands on the entire message being transmitted so in this paper we'll start by recalling the first version of pathfinder algorithm followed by an introduction to the newest release that allows us to handle hundreds of nodes in the same network finally we'll put this algorithm under test by simulating a sniffing attack with wireshark the simulation proves in addition to its efficiency to handle a great number of nodes that this new way of routing will help facing a lot of attacks based on sniffing and other type of attacks like dos

cortical networks underpinning attentional control and mentalizing converge at the right temporoparietal junction rtpj it is debated whether the rtpj is fractionated in neighboring but separate functional modules underpinning attentional control and mentalizing or whether one overarching cognitive mechanism explains the rtpj's role in both domains addressing this question we combined attentional control and mentalizing in a factorial design within one task we added a social context condition in which another individual's mental states became apparently taskrelevant to a spatial cueing paradigm this allowed for assessing cue validityand contextdependent functional activity and effective connectivity of the rtpj within corresponding cortical networks we found two discriminable rtpj subregions an anterior and a posterior one yet we did not observe a sharp functional dissociation between these two as both regions responded to attention cueing and social context manipulation the results suggest that the rtpj is part of both the ventral attention and the tom network and that its function is defined by contextdependent coupling with the respective network we argue that the rtpj as a functional unit underpins an overarching cognitive mechanism in attentional control and mentalizing and discuss how the present results help to further specify this mechanism
climate change has been shown to increase the number of mountain lakes across various mountain ranges in the world in central asia and in particular on the territory of uzbekistan a detailed assessment of glacier lakes and their evolution over time is however lacking for this reason we created the first detailed inventory of mountain lakes of uzbekistan based on recent 20022014 satellite observations usingworldview2 spot5 and ikonos imagery with a spatial resolution from 2 to 10 m this record was complemented with data from field studies of the last 50 years the previous data were mostly in the form of inventories of lakes available in soviet archives and primarily included localized insitu data the inventory of mountain lakes presented here by contrast includes an overview of all lakes of the territory of uzbekistan lakes were considered if they were located at altitudes above 1500 m and if lakes had an area exceeding 100 m 2 as in other mountain regions of the world the ongoing increase of air temperatures has led to an increase in lake number and area moreover the frequency and overall number of lake outburst events have been on the rise as well therefore we also present the first outburst assessment with an updated version of wellknown approaches considering local climate features and event histories as a result out of the 242 lakes identified on the territory of uzbekistan 15% are considered prone to outburst 10% of these lakes have been assigned low outburst potential and the remainder of the lakes have an average level of outburst potential we conclude that the distribution of lakes by elevation shows a significant influence on lake area and hazard potential no significant differences by contrast exist between the distribution of lake area outburst potential and lake location with respect to glaciers by regions c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved
machine design is one of the most important tasks in the present scenario presently machine design is done taking into account all the variables and operating conditions the process is time consuming error prone and inefficient design methodology due to lack of optimization of the performance of individual components the performance of the machine as a whole deteriorates this paper aims at demonstrating the versatility of contractbased design methodology to design machines and overcome some of the drawbacks of the traditional designing process the process variables involved in such a complex process are best modeled as fuzzy variables as they take nondiscrete values these fuzzy variables are analyzed using contractbased design an illustration of lathe machine is used to enhance the machining capability by suppressing vibrations using a fuzzy controller and contractbased design this leads to accurate machining with better tolerances and surface finish
the studies described in this article explore the influence of an underemphasized determinant of cooperative behavior in social dilemmas: affected third parties two experiments examined the effect of characteristics of third parties on individual cooperative behavior in social dilemmas and identified mechanisms associated with these relationships study 1 demonstrated that thirdparty need affects individual cooperative behavior and tested prosocial motivation and intragroup trust as mediators of this relationship study 2 provided further elaboration by demonstrating that individual cooperative behavior was reduced when a needy third party was low on reliability and by showing that prosocial motivation and intragroup trust mediated this relationship this research connects the literatures on individual cooperation in social dilemmas and relational job design and demonstrates why third parties influence individuals' cooperative behavior

the importance of tcell receptor tcr repertoire diversity is highlighted in murine models of immunodeficiency and in many human pathologies however the true extent of tcr diversity and how this diversity varies in health and disease is poorly understood in a previous issue of the european journal of immunology lossius et al eur j immunol 2014 44: 34393452 dissected the composition of the tcr repertoire in the context of multiple sclerosis ms using highthroughput sequencing of tcrbeta chains in cerebrospinal fluid samples and blood the authors demonstrated that the tcr repertoire of the csf was largely distinct from the blood and enriched in ebvreactive cd8 + t cells in ms patients studies of this kind have long been hindered by technical limitations and remain scarce in the literature however tcr sequencing methodologies are progressing apace and will undoubtedly shed light on the genetic basis of tcell responses and the ontogeny of tcellmediated diseases such as ms
nonuniform flow patterns on distillation trays can result in significant losses in separation efficiency compared to conditions with straight chordal flow paths to improve flow pattern via tray design revamps as well as for more accurate prediction of achievable separation efficiency better understanding of the flow formation is required this is however not straight forward since the evolving patterns depend on column and tray design as well as on operating conditions and may cover configurations with continuous liquid being pushed through a curtain of rising bubbles bubble regime or a continuous gas phase carrying the liquid as droplets spray regime in this study the wiremesh sensor technique was used to visualize flow patterns on larger trays the technique tracks conductivity tracer pulses during their passage across the tray a proper calibration routine was developed and a methodology is proposed to determine point liquid residence time distributions and weirtoweir liquid velocities experiments were carried out in a tray column of 800 mm diameter the feasibility study included experiments at different liquid capacities and various outlet weir obstructions tray benchmark data at high spatiotemporal resolution were obtained which are suitable for validation of cfd models for flow simulation of industrialscale sieve trays c 2016 institution of chemical engineers published by elsevier bv all rights reserved
through glacial moulins meltwater is routed from the glacier surface to its base moulins are a main feature feeding subglacial drainage systems and thus influencing basal motion and ice dynamics but their geometry remains poorly known here we show that analysis of the seismic wavefield generated by water falling into a moulin can help constrain its geometry we present modeling results of hourlong seimic tremors emitted from a vertical moulin shaft observed with a seismometer array installed at the surface of the greenland ice sheet the tremor was triggered when the moulin water level exceeded a certain height which we associate with the threshold for the waterfall to hit directly the surface of the moulin water column the amplitude of the tremor signal changed over each tremor episode in close relation to the amount of inflowing water the tremor spectrum features multiple prominent peaks whose characteristic frequencies are distributed like the resonant modes of a semiopen organ pipe and were found to depend on the moulin water level consistent with a source composed of resonant tube waves water pressure waves coupled to elastic deformation of the moulin walls along the waterfilled moulin pipe analysis of surface particle motions lends further support to this interpretation the seismic wavefield was modeled as a superposition of sustained wave radiation by pressure sources on the side walls and at the bottom of the moulin the former was found to dominate the wave field at close distance and the latter at large distance to the moulin
the integration of multibarrel glass capillaries into a microfluidic coflow configuration is demonstrated for parallel production of nanoliter scale droplets the multibarrel system supports the generation of a continuous stream of singlephase or dualphase droplets with digital control over droplet content enabling the formation of dynamicallyprogrammable and tunable emulsions the multibarrel capillary method allows simultaneous generation of multiple droplets from parallel droplet generators with controlled switching between selected dispersed phase or continuous phase compositions individual phases emerging from each capillary outlet may be selected to yield merged droplets combining continuous phase emitted from one or more neighboring droplet generators because the capillary emitters are configured in a two dimensional array the multibarrel system provides greater flexibility toward producing controlled interactions between multiple solutions and phases than conventional planar microfluidic droplet generators using a 7barrel capillary configuration the ability to regulate droplet composition and particle size of individual as well as combined single and merged waterinoil droplets is explored together with the use of twodimensional spatial control within the multibarrel array to generate higher order emulsions c 2015 elsevier bv all rights reserved
high performance parallel applications with irregular data accesses are becoming a critical workload class for modern systems in particular the execution of such workloads on emerging manycore systems is expected to be a significant component of applications in data mining machine learning scientific computing and graph analytics however power and energy constraints limit the capabilities of individual cores memory hierarchy and onchip interconnect of such systems thus leading to architectural and software tradeoffs that must be understood in the context of the intended application's behavior irregular applications are notoriously hard to optimize given their datadependent access patterns lack of structured locality and complex data structures and code patterns we have ported two irregular applications graph community detection using the louvain method grappolo and highperformance conjugate gradient hpccg to the tilera manycore system and have conducted a detailed study of platformindependent and platformspecific optimizations that improve their performance as well as reduce their overall energy consumption to conduct this study we employ an autotuning based approach that explores the optimization design space along three dimensions memory layout schemes gcc compiler flag choices and openmp loop scheduling options we leverage mit's opentuner autotuning framework to explore and recommend energy optimal choices for different combinations of parameters we then conduct an indepth architectural characterization to understand the memory behavior of the selected workloads finally we perform a correlation study to demonstrate the interplay between the hardware behavior and application characteristics using autotuning we demonstrate wholenode energy savings and performance improvements of up to 496% and 60% relative to a baseline instantiation and up to 31% and 454% relative to manually optimized variants c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
the mean platelet volume mpv red cell distribution width rdw and neutrophiltolymphocyte ratio nlr comprise laboratory markers in ankylosing spondylitis as there is a controversy in the literature regarding which type of ear involvement is characteristic of as the aim of this study was to simultaneously investigate the mpv rdw platelet to lymphocyte plr and nlr in patients with as and their relationships with highfrequency hearing thresholds thirty patients with as and 35 agematched healthy subjects were included each subject was tested with low 250 500 1000 and 2000 hz and high 4000 8000 10 000 12 000 14 000 and 16 000 hz frequency audiometry additionally the case and control groups were evaluated regarding the average hearing thresholds in bone conduction the erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr and creactive protein crp levels were measured the rdw mpv neutrophils lymphocytes and platelet counts were evaluated with the complete blood count furthermore the nlr and plr were calculated the complete blood count platelet numbers esr crp and nlr levels were significantly increased in the as patients compared with the healthy controls p005 the average values of the hearing threshold in both ears at the high frequencies of 4000 6000 8000 10 000 12 000 and 14 000 hz were significantly increased in the case group; however it was not significantly increased at 16 000 hz the current study is the first to investigate the plr nlr mpv and rdw levels in acute as we identified a significantly increased nlr leukocyte count esr and crp in as patients sensorineural hearing loss especially at extended high frequencies is common in patients with as and may represent an extraarticular feature of the disease the combined use of nlr with the leukocyte count and other clinical assessments may facilitate the diagnostic process of ankylosing spondylitis
cardiac failure has been widely associated with an increase in glucose utilization the aim of our study was to identify factors that mechanistically bridge this link between hyperglycemia and heart failure here we screened the hybrid mouse diversity panel hmdp for substratespecific cardiomyocyte candidates based on heart transcriptional profile and circulating nutrients next we utilized an in vitro model of rat cardiomyocytes to demonstrate that the gene expression changes were in direct response to substrate abundance after overlaying candidates of interest with a separate hmdp study evaluating isoproterenolinduced heart failure we chose to focus on the gene trp53inp2 as a cardiomyocyte glucose utilizationspecific factor trp53inp2 gene knockdown in rat cardiomyocytes reduced expression and protein abundance of key glycolytic enzymes this resulted in reduction of both glucose uptake and glycogen content in cardiomyocytes stimulated with isoproterenol furthermore this reduction effectively blunted the capacity of glucose and isoprotereonol to synergistically induce hypertrophic gene expression and cell size expansion we conclude that trp53inp2 serves as regulator of cardiomyocyte glycolytic activity and can consequently regulate hypertrophic response in the context of elevated glucose content new & noteworthy here we apply a novel method for screening transcripts based on a substratespecific expression pattern to identify trp53inp2 as an induced cardiomyocyte glucose utilization factor we further show that reducing expression of the gene could effectively blunt hypertrophic response in the context of elevated glucose content
an ultimate goal for those engaged in research to develop implantable medical devices is to develop mechatronic implantable artificial organs such as artificial pancreas such devices would comprise at least a sensor module an actuator module and a controller module for the development of optimal mechatronic implantable artificial organs these modules should be selfpowered and autonomously operated in this study we aimed to develop a microcontroller using the biocapacitor principle a direct electron transfer type glucose dehydrogenase was immobilized onto mesoporous carbon and then deposited on the surface of a miniaturized au electrode 7 mm 2 to prepare a miniaturized enzyme anode the enzyme fuel cell was connected with a 100 mu f capacitor and a power boost converter as a charge pump the voltage of the enzyme fuel cell was increased in a stepwise manner by the charge pump from 330 mv to 31 v and the generated electricity was charged into a 100 mu f capacitor the charge pump circuit was connected to an ultralowpower microcontroller thus prepared biocapacitor based circuit was able to operate an ultralowpower microcontroller continuously by running a program for 17 h that turned on an led every 60 s our success in operating a microcontroller using glucose as the sole energy source indicated the probability of realizing implantable selfpowered autonomously operated artificial organs such as artificial pancreas
comprehensive results from cyclic plate loading at a diameter of 300 mm supported by layers of geocell are presented the plate load tests were performed in a test pit measuring 2000 x 2000 mm in plane and 700 mm in depth to simulate half and full traffic loadings fifteen loading and unloading cycles were applied to the loading plate with amplitudes of 400 and 800 kpa the optimum embedded depth of the first layer of geocell beneath the loading plate and the optimum vertical spacing of geocell layers based on plate settlement are both approximately 02 times loading plate diameter the results show that installation of the geocell layers in the foundation bed increase the resilient behavior in addition to reduction of accumulated plastic and total settlement of pavement system efficiency of geocell reinforcement was decreased by increasing the number of the geocell layers for all applied stress levels and number of cycles of applied loading the results of the testing reveal the ability of the multiple layers of geocell reinforcement to `shakedown' to a fully resilient behavior after a period of plastic settlement except when there is little or no reinforcement and the applied cyclic pressure are large when shakedown response is observed then both the accumulated plastic settlement prior to a steadystate response being obtained and the resilient settlements thereafter are reduced the use of four layers of geocell respectively decreases the total and residual plastic settlements about 53% and 63% and increases the resilient settlement 145% compared with the unreinforced case the inclusion of the geocell layers also reduces the vertical stress transferred down through the pavement by distributing the load over a wider area for example at the end of the load cycle of the applied pressure of 800 kpa the transferred pressure at the depth of 510 mm is reduced about 214% 439% 561% for the reinforced bases with one two and three layers of geocell respectively compared to the stress in the unreinforced bed
in this paper we propose a sopcbased multiprocessor embedded system for controlling ambiental parameters in an intelligent inhabited environment the intelligent features are achieved by means of a neurofuzzy system which has the ability to learn from samples reason and adapt itself to changes in the environment or in user preferences in particular a modified version of the well known anfis adaptive neurofuzzy inference system scheme is used which allows the development of very efficient implementations the architecture proposed here is based on two softcore microprocessors: one microprocessor is dedicated to the learning and adaptive procedures whereas the other is dedicated to the online response this second microprocessor is endowed with 4 efficient ad hoc hardware modules intended to accelerate the neurofuzzy algorithms the implementation has been carried out on a xilinx virtex5 fpga and obtained results show that a very high performance system is achieved c 2014 elsevier bv all rights reserved
clouds play a pivotal role in the surface energy budget of the polar regions here we use two largely independent data sets of cloud and surface downwelling radiation observations derived by satellite remote sensing 20072010 to evaluate simulated clouds and radiation over both polar ice sheets and oceans in stateoftheart atmospheric reanalyses erainterim and modern era retrospectiveanalysis for research and applications2 and the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate model ensemble first we show that compared to clouds and the earth's radiant energy systemenergy balanced and filled cloudsatcalipso better represents cloud liquid and ice water path over high latitudes owing to its recent explicit determination of cloud phase that will be part of its new r05 release the reanalyses and climate models disagree widely on the amount of cloud liquid and ice in the polar regions compared to the observations we find significant but inconsistent biases in the model simulations of cloud liquid and ice water as well as in the downwelling radiation components the cmip5 models display a wide range of cloud characteristics of the polar regions especially with regard to cloud liquid water limiting the representativeness of the multimodel mean a few cmip5 models cnrm giss gfdl and ipsl_cm5b clearly outperform the others which enhances credibility in their projected future cloud and radiation changes over high latitudes given the rapid changes in polar regions and global feedbacks involved future climate model developments should target improved representation of polar clouds to that end remote sensing observations are crucial in spite of large remaining observational uncertainties which is evidenced by the substantial differences between the two data sets
informal groups form hierarchies and allocate social status in order to coordinate action and make collective decisions although researchers have identified characteristics of people who tend to get status the extent to which these characteristics are contextdependent is unclear in two studies participants from the united states n 157 and germany n 95 engaged in affiliative or competitive group interactions we investigated whether the nature of the group's task moderated the relationship between status attainment and personality as in previous research we found that extraversion predicted status in both competitive and affiliative contexts in contrast agreeableness was only associated with status in affiliative contexts these findings underscore the importance of examining the relationship between personality and social status in context
background: there is little information on the application and impact of revised criteria for diagnosing dementia and mild cognitive impairment mci now termed major and mild neurocognitive disorders ncds in the dsm5 we evaluate a psychometric algorithm for diagnosing dsm5 ncds in a communitydwelling sample and characterize the neuropsychological and functional profile of expertdiagnosed dsm5 ncds relative to dsmiv dementia and international working group criteria for mci methods: a populationbased sample of 1644 adults aged 7278 years was assessed algorithmic diagnostic criteria used detailed neuropsychological data medical history longitudinal cognitive performance and informant interview those meeting all criteria for at least one diagnosis had data reviewed by a neurologist expert diagnosis who achieved consensus with a psychiatrist for complex cases results: the algorithm accurately classified dsm5 major ncd area under the curve auc 095 95% confidence interval ci 092097 dsmiv dementia auc 091 95% ci 085097 dsm5 mild ncd auc 075 95% ci 0700 80 and mci auc 076 95% ci 072081 when compared to expert diagnosis expert diagnosis of dementia using dsm5 criteria overlapped with 90% of dsmiv dementia cases but resulted in a 127% increase in diagnosis relative to dsmiv additional cases had less severe memory language impairment and instrumental activities of daily living iadl impairments compared to cases meeting dsmiv criteria for dementia dsm5 mild ncd overlapped with 83% of mci cases and resulted in a 19% increase in diagnosis these additional cases had a subtly different neurocognitive profile to mci cases including poorer social cognition conclusion: dsm5 ncd criteria can be operationalized in a psychometric algorithm in a population setting expert diagnosis using dsm5 ncd criteria captured most cases with dsmiv dementia and mci in our sample but included many additional cases suggesting that dsm5 criteria are broader in their categorization

introduction: spinal epidural hematoma seh is a rare disease that causes cord compression and neurologic deficit spontaneous seh is related to minor trauma bleeding disorders and anticoagulant medications posttraumatic seh has been associated with lowenergy spine hyperextension injuries in patients with ankylosing spinal disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis dish a variant named atypical dishlike with seh is reported objective: to describe the management diagnosis and treatment of an unusual seh case in a patient causing delayed neurologic deficit with rigid atypical dishlike spine case description: an elderly woman with prior antiplatelet therapy presented with delayed neurological deficit suffering trauma after falling computed tomography ct imaging studies reveal hyperextension fracture pattern and signs mimic dish missed on standard xray images magnetic resonance mr study demonstrates posterior epidural mass compatible with seh in thoracic spine with cord compression using a midline posterior approach an urgent intervention and a left multiple partial unilateral decompressive laminectomy at t4t7 and a long instrumented fusion at t3t9 were performed for achieving spinal stability and neurological improvement both of which were observed conclusion: patients with rigid spine who sustain lowenergy injuries may be prone to have a fracture and epidural hematoma especially if they take anticoagulant medications imaging studies including mr and ct scans should be reviewed carefully to rule out any occult fracture urgent or early surgical hematoma drainage and instrumented fusion must be performed to achieve stability and functional recovery
activated bcells increase tcell behaviour during autoimmune disease and other infections by means of cytokine production and antigenpresentation functional studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis eae indicate that bcell deficiencies and a lack of il10 and il35 leads to a poor prognosis we hypothesised that bcells play a role during tuberculosis we evaluated bcell mrna expression using realtime pcr from healthy community controls individuals with other lung diseases and newly diagnosed untreated pulmonary tb patients at three different time points diagnosis month 2 and 6 of treatment we show that faslg il5ra cd38 and il4 expression was lower in bcells from tb cases compared to healthy controls the changes in expression levels of cd38 may be due to a reduced activation of bcells from tb cases at diagnosis by month 2 of treatment there was a significant increase in the expression of april and il5ra in tb cases furthermore after 6 months of treatment april faslg il5ra and cd19 were upregulated in bcells from tb cases the increase in the expression of april and cd19 suggests that there may be restored activation of bcells following antitb treatment the upregulation of faslg and il5ra indicates that bcells expressing regulatory genes may play an important role in the protective immunity against m tb infection our results show that increased activation of bcells is present following successful tb treatment and that the expression of faslg and il5ra could potentially be utilised as a signature to monitor treatment response

nowadays distributed denial of service ddos becomes a major challenge in the network as it affects the network at multilevel this leads to traffic overhead and wastage of bandwidth utilisation in order to overcome these issues antbased ddos detection technique using roaming virtual honeypots is proposed in this technique virtual roaming honeypot along with the multilevel secure architecture is used to collect the information about the various intruders at different levels in the network ant colony optimisation technique is used to detect the intruders based on the pheromone deposit on that considered area a multilevel ip log table is used to detect the intruders at different levels of the network once the affected area is found the information is sent to multilevel architecture to limit the spread of the affected area to the honeypot this information is sent to the honeypot to make a defence system against the attackers the advantage of the proposed technique is that it provides a full defence against ddos at multilevel without creating any traffic overhead
chemotaxis the microorganisms autonomous motility along or against the concentration gradients of a chemical species is an important yet often neglected factor controlling the transport of bacteria through saturated porous media for example chemotactic bacteria could enhance bioremediation by directing their own motion to residual contaminants trapped in low hydraulic conductive zones of contaminated aquifers the aim of the present work is to develop an accurate numerical scheme to model chemotaxis in saturated porous media and other advective dominating flow systems we propose to model chemotaxis by using a new class of meshless lagrangian particle methods we recently developed for applications in fluid mechanics the method is based on the smooth particle hydrodynamics sph formulation of ben moussa et al int ser numer math 13 1 :2962 2006 combined with a new weighted essentially nonoscillatory weno reconstruction technique on moving point clouds in multiple space dimensions the purpose of this new numerical scheme is to fully exploit the advantages of sph among traditional meshbased and meshfree schemes and to overcome drawbacks related to the use of standard sph for modeling chemotaxis in porous media first we test the new scheme against analytical reference solutions then under the assumption of complete mixing at the darcy scale we perform twodimensional conservative solute transport simulations under steadystate flow conditions to show the capability of the proposed new scheme to model chemotaxis
efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing carbon investment while growing taller and any deficiency of carbon availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow therefore plants need to coordinate carbon assimilation and biomass allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe longdistance transport system we tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with carbonsaving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in biomass allocation to xylem we measured leaf biomass hydraulic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing sg and 10 fast growing fg fraxinus ornus l trees branches of sg trees had five times slower branch elongation rate 7 vs 35 cm year 1 and produced a higher leaf biomass p < 00001 and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels p005 and xylem safety psi 50 approximate to 32 mpa slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of carbon costs associated with growth while maintaining similar leafspecific conductivity and xylem safety
purpose of review myelodysplastic syndromes mds have remarkably diverse somatic mutation patterns that can be challenging to interpret clinically yet genetic information is increasingly available to physicians this review will examine several implications of genetic diversity in mds recent findings somatic mutations can serve as clinically relevant biomarkers in mds molecular subtypes may exist that share clinical features including risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia response to treatment and overall survival several mutated genes are known to have prognostic value that is independent of common risk stratification tools mutations of several genes identify lowblast percentage patients with greater than predicted disease risk while only sf3b1 mutations predict lower disease risk than expected mutations of tp53 are associated with adverse features yet demonstrate inferior outcomes than predicted by these risk factors sf3b1 and tp53 mutations may identify clinically relevant subtypes of mds and allow for better refinement of risk within these groups using somatic mutations to diagnose mds is more challenging because they can occur in healthy individuals yet patients with unexplained cytopenias have a high rate of clonal hematopoiesis that may be an important risk factor to identify clinically summary patterns of somatic mutations are diverse in mds but can inform the prediction of prognosis and aid in its diagnosis
perceptual systems must rapidly generate accurate representations of the world from sensory inputs that are corrupted by internal and external noise we can typically obtain more veridical representations by integrating information from multiple channels but this integration can lead to biases when inputs are in fact not from the same source although a considerable amount is known about how different sources of information are combined to influence what we perceive it is not known whether temporal features are combined it is vital to address this question given the divergent predictions made by different models of cue combination and time perception concerning the plausibility of crossmodal temporal integration and the implications that such integration would have for research programs in action control and social cognition here we present four experiments investigating the influence of movement duration on the perceived duration of an auditory tone participants either explicitly experiments 12 or implicitly experiments 34 produced hand movements of shorter or longer durations while judging the duration of a concurrently presented tone 500950 ms in duration across all experiments judgments of tone duration were attracted toward the duration of executed movements ie tones were perceived to be longer when executing a movement of longer duration our results demonstrate that temporal information associated with movement biases perceived auditory duration placing important constraints on theories modeling cue integration for state estimation as well as models of time perception action control and social cognition
through a discussion of drone warfare and in particular the massacre of 23 people in the uruzgan province in afghanistan in 2010 i argue that drone warfare is both embodied and embodying drawing from posthuman feminist theorists such as donna haraway and n katherine hayles i understand the turn toward data and machine intelligence not as an otherthanhuman process of decisionmaking that deprives humans of sovereignty but as a form of embodiment that reworks and undermines essentialist notions of culture and nature biology and technology through the intermediation of algorithmic visual and affective modes of embodiment drone warfare reproduces gendered and racialized bodies that enable a necropolitics of massacre finally the category of gender demonstrates a flaw in the supposed perfectibility of the algorithm in removing issues of identity or prejudice from security practices as well as the perceptions of drone assemblages as comprising sublime technologies of perfect analysis and vision gender as both a mode of embodiment and a category of analysis is not removed by algorithmic war but rather is put into the service of the violence it enables

many hospitality consumption experiences are shared with fellow consumers such as acquaintances friends or family members yet research examining the impact of fellow consumers' presence on consumers' donation behaviors is scant to bridge that gap the current research examines how the presence of fellow consumers influences consumers' donation behaviors in a restaurant setting results from our experiment reveal that the impact of fellow consumers' presence depends on two factors: observability of the donation and donation appeal type specifically we found that when the act of donating is unobservable by others and the donation appeal highlights selfbenefits the presence of fellow consumers drives individuals to exhibit more favorable attitude and higher levels of donation intention conversely when the act of donation is observable by others and the donation appeal portrays other benefits the presence of fellow consumers makes individuals to exhibit less favorable attitude and lower levels of donation intention furthermore our mediation analyses show that anticipated emotional benefits is the underlying psychological mechanism explaining the effects we discuss the theoretical contributions and managerial implications of our findings as well as limitations and opportunities for future research
background: this study examined whether starting buprenorphine treatment prior to prison and after release from prison would be associated with better drug treatment outcomes and whether males and females responded differently to the combination of inprison treatment and postrelease service setting methods: study design was a 2 inprison treatment: condition: buprenorphine treatment: vs counseling only x 2 postrelease service setting condition: opioid treatment: program otp vs community health center chc x 2 gender factorial design the trial was conducted between september 2008 and july 2012 followup assessments were completed in 2014 participants were recruited from two baltimore prerelease prisons one for men and one for women adult prerelease prisoners who were heroindependent during the year prior to incarceration were eligible postrelease assessments were conducted at 1 3 6 and 12month following prison release results: participants n 211 in the inprison treatment condition effect had a higher mean number of days of community buprenorphine treatment compared to the condition in which participants initiated medication after release p 0005 however there were no statistically significant hypothesized effects for the inprison treatment condition in terms of: days of heroin use and crime and opioid and cocaine positive urine screening test results all ps >014 and no statistically significant hypothesized gender effects all ps >018 conclusions: although initiating buprenorphine treatment in prison compared to afterrelease was associated with more days receiving buprenorphine treatment in the designated community treatment program during the 12months postrelease assessment it was not associated with superior outcomes in terms of heroin and cocaine use and criminal behavior c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved
this article explores how canadian youth who participate in gaystraight alliances gsa and teachers who advise them perceive and/or experience bi/pansexuality participants' perspectives on definitions of and alignment with bi/pansexuality are examined as they unpack mis/understandings associated with nonmonosexual identities for gsa members bisexual and pansexual identity labels were not interchangeable terms; bisexuality was associated with the fe/male binary and pansexuality served as a personal contestation to this dichotomy despite these distinctions both nonmonosexualities were marked by invisibility mis/understandings and prejudice in school findings emphasize how students' knowledge of sexual diversity and fluidity wasmore nuanced than their gsa advisors due to personal online research gsa participation enabled bi/pansexual knowledge exchange among students and teachers and promoted overall understandings of bi/pansexualities although gsa involvement facilitated opportunities to discuss bi/pansexualities this article also highlights how an effort should be made to integrate bi/pansexual content in these clubs

the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa technique is based on the specific recognition ability of the molecular structure of an antigen epitope by an antibody and is likely the most important diagnostic technique used today in bioscience with this methodology it is possible to diagnose illness allergies alimentary fraud and even to detect small molecules such as toxins pesticides heavy metals etc for this reason any procedures that improve the detection limit sensitivity or reduce the analysis time could have an important impact in several fields in this respect many methods have been developed for improving the technique ranging from fluorescence substrates to methods for increasing the number of enzyme molecules involved in the detection such as the biotinstreptavidin method in this context nanotechnology has offered a significant number of proposed solutions mainly based on the functionalization of nanoparticles from gold to carbon which could be used as antibody carriers as well as reporter enzymes like peroxidase however few works have focused on the study of best practices for nanoparticle functionalization for elisa enhancement in this work we use 20 nm gold nanoparticles aunps as a vehicle for secondary antibodies and peroxidase hrp the design of experiments technique doe and four different methods for biomolecule loading were compared using a rabbit igg/goat antirabbit igg elisa model adsorption directional covalent and a combination thereof as a result aunp probes prepared by direct adsorption were the most effective method aunps probes were then used to detect gliadin one of the main components of wheat gluten the protein composite that causes celiac disease with this optimized approach our data showed a sensitivity increase of at least five times and a lower detection limit with respect to a standard elisa of at least three times additionally the assay time was remarkably decreased
despite advances in women's equality and perhaps as a result of it sexist humor is prevalent in society research on this topic has lacked realism in the way the humor is conveyed to participants and has not examined perceptions of both men and women who use sexist humor we embedded jokes in printed facebook profiles to present sexist humor to participants we manipulated the gender of the individual in the profile man or woman and the type of joke presented antimen antiwomen neutral in a 2 x 3 betweengroups design we found that both men and women rated antiwomen jokes as more sexist than neutral humor and women also rated antimen jokes as sexist we also found that men who displayed antiwomen humor were perceived less positively than men displaying antimen humor or women displaying either type of humor these findings suggest that there may be different gender norms in place for joke tellers regarding who is an acceptable target of sexist humor
water is one of the most important resources in the world because it is essential for the life recently several strategies for the proper use of water in different sectors industrial agricultural and domestic have been ported which involve options such as recycling reusing and regeneration however the overall water management in a macroscopic level has received lower attention in the macroscopic level numerous water uses are involved and several sources of freshwater can interact to satisfy the freshwater demands where also recycling reusing and regeneration strategies can be implemented therefore in this paper is proposed a new optimization formulation for the proper use of water in a macroscopic level involving water recycling reusing and regeneration as well as accounting for the impact in the surrounding watershed a case study from the centralwest part of mexico was analyzed and the results show that is possible to reduce the freshwater consumption by 21 % with an investment of us $686 510 000/year

extraction of road networks in urban areas from remotely sensed imagery plays an important role in many urban applications eg road navigation geometric correction of urban remote sensing images updating geographic information systems etc it is normally difficult to accurately differentiate road from its background due to the complex geometry of the buildings and the acquisition geometry of the sensor in this paper we present a new method for extracting roads from highresolution imagery based on hierarchical graphbased image segmentation the proposed method consists of: 1 extracting features eg using gabor and morphological filtering to enhance the contrast between road and nonroad pixels 2 graphbased segmentation consisting of i constructing a graph representation of the image based on initial segmentation and ii hierarchical merging and splitting of image segments based on color and shape features and 3 postprocessing to remove irregularities in the extracted road segments experiments are conducted on three challenging datasets of highresolution images to demonstrate the proposed method and compare with other similar approaches the results demonstrate the validity and superior performance of the proposed method for road extraction in urban areas c 2017 international society for photogrammetry and remote sensing inc isprs published by elsevier bv all rights reserved
appraisal research has traditionally focused on negative emotions but has not addressed issues concerning the relationships between several positive emotions and appraisals in daily life and the extent to which cooccurrence of positive emotions can be explained by overlap in appraisals driven by a priori hypotheses on appraisalemotion relationships this study investigated 12 positive emotions and 13 appraisal dimensions using ecological momentary assessment the results provide strong evidence that positive emotions and appraisals correlate significantly in daily life importantly we found that the positive emotions' overlap on theoretically relevant as compared to irrelevant appraisals was stronger and more predictive of their cooccurrence furthermore appraisal overlap on theoretically relevant appraisals predicted the cooccurrence of positive emotions even when the appraisal of pleasantness was excluded indicating that positive emotions do not cooccur just by virtue of their shared valence our findings affirmed and refined the appraisal profiles of positive emotions and underscore the importance of appraisals in accounting for the commonality and differences among positive emotions
additive manufacturing am or 3d printing refers to a new class of technologies that actively construct products directly from any 3d digital model in the future the broader applications of am will require a cost reduction of am machines currently the products fabricated by lowend machines such as those fabricated using fused deposition modeling fdm processes suffer from the issue of low dimensional accuracy due to multiple error sources to properly manage error sources for improved prevision this paper proposes a novel strategy for error compensation in the fdm processes first we consecutively attribute the dimensional inaccuracy to two major error sources that affect the geometric shape of the product: 1 positioning error of the extruder and 2 shape deformation induced by processing error including material phase change and other variations that occur the extruder positioning error is characterized by a kriging model while the modeling of shape deformation due to processing error follows the method developed by huang et al second using error equivalence concept we transform the positioning error into the equivalent amount of design input error finally we adjust the design to compensate for the overall shape deviation to validate this strategy we conduct a designed experiment for the shape deviation prediction and the compensation the experimental results successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed threestep strategy to manage multiple error sources in the fdm processes note to practitionersat present the shape deviation of the product hinders the application of additive manufacturing in extensive industries this paper propose an inplane compensation plan for a fused deposition modeling fdm process mathematical models are built to predict the deviation of a 2d shape and a compensation algorithm is derived based on this model with the methodology described in this paper a special compensation system can be developed for an fdm machine this system analyzes the measurement of specifically designed test products derives a compensation plan and modifies any 2d computeraided design model to increase the shape fidelity of the product

invasion into new areas by already widespread pest organisms often occurs through nonobvious routes with the origins of such invasions difficult to determine understanding population structure using multiple datatypes can help untangle past dispersal events and reveal putative contemporary invasion pathways the tephritid fruit fly zeugodacus cucurbitae coquillett is a serious pest of cucurbits and other commercial crops and is considered native to the indooriental region but is invasive in both africa and the pacific here we combine molecular microsatellites and coi and morphological male genetalia length and wing shape geometric morphometrics data within an integrative taxonomic framework to test hypotheses concerning levels of z cucurbitae population variation observed in southeast asia native range 10 sites similar to 200 individuals versus the west pacific invasive range 4 sites similar to 80 individuals and whether single or multiple introductions of z cucurbitae have occurred into the west pacific we also use this case to explicitly test if using an integrative approach provides more information about hypothesized invasion pathways than either genetic or morphological approaches would do alone all datasets support z cucurbitae as being more variable in southeast asia than the west pacific and within these regions populations appear to be structured geographically in particular mainland and sundaic southeast asian locations formed separate clusters and new guinea and solomon islands were not closely related to guam and hawaii evidence supports a separate single origin for new guinea from the melanesian arc the solomon islands from malaysia/singapore and guam from mainland asia but multiple introductions into hawaii from mainland asia taken together we argue that there is great value in integrating evidence from multiple sources as it can provide finer resolution of population relationships than any single data source alone

empathy is fundamental for interpersonal relationships and therapy there is some theoretical dissensus about its underlying process this study investigated the lived experience of understanding another person through an innovative combination of qualitative methods the design involved making video recordings of interpersonal interactions between pairs of volunteers the recordings were then used for a sameday cuedrecall interview during the interview both volunteers were asked to discuss their interaction experiences four indepth case studies involving eight participants were conducted using this technique the interviews were then subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis the results illuminate the multidimensional characteristics of interpersonal understanding namely understanding another person was experienced as a phenomenon with three main aspects to it: 1 intuitive; 2 shared/sympathetic; and 3 imaginative/ intellectual interestingly shared/sympathetic and imaginative/intellectual understandings were more strongly connected with insights accessed via verbal communication and with more selfbased understandings on the other hand intuitive understandings were typically linked to the nonverbal communication domain and with more otherbased intersubjective or prereflective forms of understanding we argue that intuitive understandings have been underrepresented in the empathy literature and should be acknowledged as an important experiential component of this phenomenon to be distinguished from intellectual and sympathetic understandings

background equal access to mainstream healthcare services for people with intellectual disabilities id still requires attention although recent studies suggest that health professionals hold positive attitudes towards people with id stigmatising attitudes may influence their efforts to serve people with id in community healthcare practice to stimulate inclusion in mainstream healthcare services this systematic review focussed on barriers in attitudes of mainstream health professionals towards people with id method five electronic databases were systematically searched and references in full text articles were checked for studies published in the english language between january 1994 and january 2016 a socialpsychological triad of cognitive affective and behavioural dimensions of stigmatising attitudes is used to structure and discuss the results results the literature search generated 2190 records with 30 studies that passed our exclusion criteria studies were mostly crosssectional and of moderate quality with respect to stigma a lack of familiarity with and knowledge about people with id was found id was considered as a stable condition not under personal control moreover mainstream health professionals had either low or high expectations of the capabilities of people with id professionals reported stress lack of confidence fear and anxiety a tendency to treat people with id differently and a lack of supporting autonomy conclusions stigmatising attitudes towards people with id appeared to be present among mainstream health professionals this might affect the ongoing challenges regarding inclusion in mainstream healthcare services to facilitate inclusion in mainstream healthcare services it is recommended to include contact and collaboration with expertsbyexperience in education programs of health professionals future research should progress beyond descriptive accounts of stigma towards exploring relationships between cognitive affective and behavioural dimensions as pointers for intervention finally inclusion would benefit from an understanding of equal' treatment that means reasonable adjustments instead of undifferentiated treatment
background: a steadily increasing pattern of breast cancer mortality has been reported in south korea since the late 1980s this paper explored the trends of educational inequalities of female breast cancer mortality between 1983 and 2012 in korea and conducted ageperiodcohort apc analysis by educational level methods: agestandardized mortality rates of breast cancer per 100 000 personyears were calculated relative index of inequality rii for breast cancer mortality was used as an inequality measure apc analyses were conducted using the web tool for apc analysis provided by the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the us national cancer institute results: an increasing trend in breast cancer mortality among korean women between 1983 and 2012 was due to the increased mortality of the lower education groups ie no formal education or primary education and secondary education groups not the highest education group the breast cancer mortality was higher in women with a tertiary education than in women with no education or a primary education during 19831992 and the reverse was true in 19932012 consequently rii was changed from positive to negative associations in the early 2000s the lower education groups had the increased breast cancer mortality and significant cohort and period effects between 1983 and 2012 whereas the highest group did not conclusions: apc analysis by socioeconomic position used in this study could provide an important clue for the causes on breast cancer mortality the longterm monitoring of socioeconomic patterning in breast cancer risk factors is urgently needed
groundwater management practices need to take hydrogeology the agroclimate and demand for groundwater into account since agroclimatic zones have already been demarcated by the government of india it would aid policy makers to understand the status of groundwater recharge and discharge in each agroclimatic zone however developing effective policies to manage groundwater at agroclimatic zone and state levels is constrained due to a paucity of temporal data and information with the launch of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission in 2002 it is now possible to obtain frequent data at broad spatial scales and use it to examine past trends in rain induced recharge and groundwater use in this study the grace data were used to estimate changes to monthly total water storage tws and groundwater storage in different agroclimatic zones of rajasthan india furthermore the longterm annual and seasonal groundwater storage trends in the state were estimated using the grace data and the trends were compared with those in rainfall data the methodology based on grace data was found to be useful in detecting large scale trends in groundwater storage changes covering different agroclimatic zones the analysis of data shows that groundwater storage trends depend on rainfall in previous years and therefore on the antecedent moisture conditions overall the study indicates that if suitable groundwater recharge methods and sites are identified for the state there is potential to achieve more groundwater recharge than what is currently occurring and thus enhancing the availability of water for irrigated agriculture
communication has a major impact on how customers perceive sellers and their organizations especially the nonverbal communication such as body language appearance facial expressions gestures proximity posture eye contact that can influence positively or negatively the first impression of customers and their experiences in stores salespeople in many countries especially the developing ones are just telling about their companies' products because they are unaware of the real role of sellers and the importance of nonverbal communication in saudi arabia the seller profession has been exclusively for foreign labor until 2006 it is very recently that saudi workforce enters to the retailing sector as sellers the nonverbal communication of those sellers has never been evaluated from consumer's point of view therefore the aim of this paper is to explore the nonverbal communication barriers that customers are facing when dealing with saudi sellers after discussing the nonverbal communication skills that sellers must have in the light of the previous academic research and the depth interviews with seven focus groups of saudi customers this study found that the saudi customers were not totally satisfied with the current nonverbal communication skills of saudi sellers therefore it is strongly recommended to develop the nonverbal communication skills of saudi sellers by intensive trainings to distinguish more the appearance of their sellers especially the female ones to focus on the time of intervention as well as the proximity to customers c aimi journals
joint sparse representation jsr has shown great potential in various image processing and computer vision tasks nevertheless the conventional jsr is fragile to outliers in this paper we propose a weighted jsr wjsr model to simultaneously encode a set of data samples that are drawn from the same subspace but corrupted with noise and outliers our model is desirable to exploit the common information shared by these data samples while reducing the influence of outliers to solve the wjsr model we further introduce a greedy algorithm called weighted simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit to efficiently approximate the global optimal solution then we apply the wjsr for mixed noise removal by jointly coding the grouped nonlocal similar image patches the denoising performance is further improved by incorporating it with the global prior and the sparse errors into a unified framework experimental results show that our denoising method is superior to several stateoftheart mixed noise removal methods
middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus merscov is transmitted via the respiratory tract and causes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome by infecting lung epithelial cells and macrophages macrophages can readily recognize the virus and eliminate it merscov infects cells via its spike s glycoprotein that binds on dipeptidylpeptidase 4 dpp4 receptor present on macrophages whether this spike/dpp4 association affects macrophage responses remains unknown herein we demonstrated that infection of macrophages with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with merscov s glycoprotein results in suppression of macrophage responses since it reduced the capacity of macrophages to produce tnfa and il6 in naive and lpsactivated thp1 macrophages and augmented lpsinduced production of the immunosuppressive cytokine il10 merscov s glycoprotein induced the expression of the negative regulator of tlr signaling irakm as well as of the transcriptional repressor ppar gamma inhibition of dpp4 by its inhibitor sitagliptin or sirna abrogated the effects of merscov s glycoprotein on irakm ppar gamma and il10 confirming that its immunosuppressive effects were mediated by dpp4 receptor the effect was observed both in thp1 macrophages and human primary peripheral blood monocytes these findings support a dpp4mediated suppressive action of merscov in macrophages and suggest a potential target for effective elimination of its pathogenicity
cultures of honor such as turkey prioritize defending individual and family reputations but in genderspecific ways nisbett and cohen 1996 men maintain honor via reputations for toughness aggression control over women and avenging insults women maintain honor through obedience to men sexual modesty and religious piety honor beliefs support women's subordination justifying violence against them sev'er and yurdakul violence against women 7 964998 2001 and therefore should be challenged understanding honor beliefs' ideological correlates may inform such efforts we hypothesized that benevolent sexism a subjectively favorable systemjustifying ideology would more strongly positively predict turkish women's versus men's honor beliefs; whereas hostile sexism which is openly antagonistic toward women would more strongly positively predict turkish men's versus women's honor beliefs additionally due to justifications for gender inequality embedded in islamic religious teachings we expected islamic religiosity to positively predict honor beliefs for both genders a convenience sample of turkish undergraduates 313 women and 122 men in ankara completed the ambivalent sexism inventory religious orientation scale and honor endorsement index regression analyses revealed that benevolent but not hostile sexism positively predicted women's honor beliefs whereas hostile but not benevolent sexism positively predicted men's honor beliefs islamic religiosity positively predicted honor beliefs for both genders but unexpectedly did so more strongly for men than women we suggest that combating benevolent sexism and promoting feminist interpretations of islamic religiosity may help to empower turkish women to challenge honor beliefs
recently yang and hwang int j theor phys 53 224 2014 demonstrated that the scheme to share information via employing discrete algorithm to quantum states presented by kang and fang commun theor phys 55 239 2011 suffers from a major vulnerability allowing an eavesdropper to perform a measurement and resend attack by introducing an additional checking state framework the authors have proposed an improved protocol to overcome this weakness this work calls into question the invoked vulnerability in order to clarify a misinterpretation in the same protocol stages also introduce a possible leakage information strategy known as a faked state attack despite the proposed improvement which means that the same security problem may persist finally an upgrading technic was introduced in order to enhance the security transmission
various types of longterm stable relationships that individuals uphold including cooperation and competition between group members define social complexity in vertebrates numerous life history physiological and cognitive traits have been shown to affect or to be affected by such social relationships as such differences in developmental modes ie the 'altricialprecocial' spectrum may play an important role in understanding the interspecific variation in occurrence of social interactions but to what extent this is the case is unclear because the role of the developmental mode has not been studied directly in acrossspecies studies of sociality in other words although there are studies on the effects of developmental mode on brain size on the effects of brain size on cognition and on the effects of cognition on social complexity there are no studies directly investigating the link between developmental mode and social complexity this is surprising because developmental differences play a significant role in the evolution of for example brain size which is in turn considered an essential building block with respect to social complexity here we compiled an overview of studies on various aspects of the complexity of social systems in altricial and precocial mammals and birds although systematic studies are scarce and do not allow for a quantitative comparison we show that several forms of social relationships and cognitive abilities occur in species along the entire developmental spectrum based on the existing evidence it seems that differences in developmental modes play a minor role in whether or not individuals or species are able to meet the cognitive capabilities and requirements for maintaining complex social relationships given the scarcity of comparative studies and potential subtle differences however we suggest that future studies should consider developmental differences to determine whether our finding is general or whether some of the vast variation in social complexity across species can be explained by developmental mode this would allow a more detailed assessment of the relative importance of developmental mode in the evolution of vertebrate social systems

wave overtopping is one of the key parameters for designing coastal structures: the crest level is usually determined using admissible overtopping discharges several formulae already exist for wave overtopping assessment that predict the average overtopping discharge per meter width of the coastal defence generally for deep or intermediate water depths at the toe of the dike however the process of wave overtopping on sea dikes with shallow and very shallow foreshore is not yet fully understood gentle foreshores in combination with very shallow water conditions lead to heavy wave breaking and a significant change of the wave spectra from offshore to the toe of the dike the wave steepness is assumed as one of the main criteria to identify cases of severe wave breaking on shallow and very shallow foreshores for these conditions van gent's formula generally used for wave overtopping with shallow foreshores has been implemented and validated against experimental data it is the purpose of this paper to show that van gent's formula overestimates the average overtopping discharge for cases of very shallow foreshores moreover the existing formula cannot be applied to cases with an emergent toe the present work therefore introduces a new equivalent slope concept to obtain an estimation of average wave overtopping discharges on sea dikes with shallow and very shallow foreshores this study uses data from clash database and experimental campaigns specifically carried out at flanders hydraulics research belgium in order to validate this approach results indicate that this concept shows better performance compared to other empirical formulae which suggests that the influence of the very shallow foreshore on the average wave overtopping discharge should be included c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
a model that accurately predicts at the time of admission the length of stay los for hospitalized patients could be an effective tool for healthcare providers it could enable early interventions to prevent complications enabling more efficient utilization of manpower and facilities in hospitals in this study we apply a regression tree cubist model for predicting the los based on static inputs that is values that are known at the time of admission and that do not change during patient's hospital stay the model was trained and validated on deidentified administrative data from the veterans health administration vha hospitals in pittsburgh pa we chose to use a cubist model because it produced more accurate predictions than did alternative techniques in addition tree models enable us to examine the classification rules learned from the data in order to better understand the factors that are most correlated with hospital los cubist recursively partitions the data set as it estimates linear regressions for each partition and the error level differs for different partitions so that it is possible to deduce what are the characteristics of patients whose los can be accurately predicted at admission and what are the characteristics of patients for whom the los estimate at that point in time is more highly uncertain for example our model indicates that the prediction error is greater for patients who had more admissions in the recent past and for those who had longer previous hospital stays our approach suggests that mapping the cases into a higher dimensional space using a radial basis function rbf kernel helps to separate them by their level of cubist error using a support vector machine svm c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
classification and numeric estimation are the two most common types of data mining the goal of classification is to predict the discrete type of output values whereas estimation is aimed at finding the continuous type of output values predictive data mining is generally achieved by using only one specific statistical or machine learning technique to construct a prediction model related studies have shown that prediction performance by this kind of single flat model can be improved by the utilization of some hierarchical structures hierarchical estimation approaches usually a combination of multiple estimation models have been proposed for solving some specific domain problems however in the literature there is no generic hierarchical approach for estimation and no hybrid based solution that combines classification and estimation techniques hierarchically therefore we introduce a generic hierarchical architecture namely hierarchical classification and regression hcr suitable for various estimation problems simply speaking the first level of hcr involves preprocessing a given training set by classifying it into k classes leading to k subsets three approaches are used to perform this task in this study: hard classification hc ; fuzzy cmeans fcm ; and genetic algorithms ga then each training data containing its associated class label is used to train a support vector machine svm classifier for classification next for the second level of hcr k regression or estimation models are trained based on their corresponding subsets for final prediction the experiments based on 8 different uci datasets show that most hierarchical prediction models developed with the hcr architecture significantly outperform three wellknown single fiat prediction models ie linear regression lr multilayer perceptron mlp neural networks and support vector regression svr in terms of mean absolute percentage error mape and root mean squared error rmse rates in addition it is found that using the gabased data preprocessing approach to classify the training set into 4 subsets is the best threshold ie k4 and the 4class svm+mlp outperforms three baseline hierarchical regression models

objective: recent studies have suggested that autoimmune diseases and immune activation play a part in the pathogenesis of different neurodevelopmental disorders this study investigated the association between a personal history and a family history of autoimmune disease and the risk of developing attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder adhd method: a cohort was formed of all singletons born in denmark from 1990 to 2007 resulting in a study population of 983 680 individuals followed from 1995 to 2012 information on autoimmune diseases was obtained from the danish national hospital register individuals with adhd were identified through the danish national hospital register and the danish psychiatric central register results: in total 23 645 children were diagnosed with adhd during the study period autoimmune disease in the individual was associated with an increased risk of adhd by an incidence rate ratio of 124 95% ci 110140 the primary analyses associated maternal autoimmune disease with adhd in the offspring incidence rate ratio 112 95% ci 106119 whereas a paternal history of autoimmune diseases was not significantly associated with adhd in the offspring in exploratory analyses an increased risk of adhd was observed for children with a family history of thyrotoxicosis type 1 diabetes autoimmune hepatitis psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis conclusion: a personal history and a maternal history of autoimmune disease were associated with an increased risk of adhd the previously reported association between type 1 diabetes and adhd was confirmed in addition specific parental autoimmune diseases were associated with adhd in offspring
academic research and technological innovation associated with rainwater harvesting rwh systems in the uk has seen a shift of emphasis in recent years traditional design approaches use whole life cost assessments that prioritise financial savings associated with the provision of an alternative water supply however researchers and practitioners are increasingly recognising broader benefits associated with rainwater reuse such as stormwater attenuation benefits this paper identifies and describes a set of novel rwh system configurations that have potential for deployment in uk houses conceptual schematics are provided to define these innovations alongside traditional configurations discussion of the drivers supporting these configurations illustrates the opportunities for rwh deployment in a wide range of settings a quantitative multi criteria analysis was used to evaluate and score the configurations under a range of emerging criteria the work identifies several rwh system configurations that can outperform traditional ones in terms of specified cost and benefits selection of a specific rwh technology is shown to be highly dependent on user priorities it is proposed that the system configurations highlighted could enable rwh to be costeffectively installed in a broad set of contexts that have experienced minimal exploitation to date
mast cells are innate immune cells that respond rapidly to infection in barrier tissues such as the skin and intestinal mucosa expulsion of parasitic worms in the gut involves a robust type 2 host response and an acute mastocytosis is often generated at the site of infection however the role of mast cells in resistance to worm infections appears to be parasite specific mast cells are also involved in tissue repair but the longterm contribution of mast cell activation after worm expulsion has not been definitively studied in this issue of european journal of immunology sorobetea et al eur j immunol 2017 47: 257268 demonstrate that activated mast cells persist in the large intestinal lamina propria and intraepithelial compartment long after worm expulsion resulting in continued local and systemic presence of the mast cell protease mast cell protease 1 mcpt1 and enhanced intestinal permeability in this commentary we discuss these findings in the wider context of mast cell function in health and disease
one triumph of the human mind is the ability to place the multitudinous array of people we encounter into inand outgroup members based on racial characteristics one fundamental question that remains to be answered is whether invisible own and otherrace faces can nevertheless influence subsequent affective judgments here we employed continuous flash suppression cfs to render own and otherrace faces unperceivable in an affective priming task both online and offline awareness checks were employed to provide more stringent control of partial awareness results revealed that relative to ownrace faces imperceptible otherrace faces significantly facilitated participants' identification of negative words suggesting an otherrace derogation bias when faces were presented consciously we found that not only otherrace faces facilitated detection of negative words but also ownrace faces facilitated detection of positive words these findings together provide novel and strong evidence suggesting that invisible racial faces can bias affective responses c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved
this paper presents the results of an experimental model study of the transient loading of steam generator tubes during a postulated main steam line break mslb accident in a nuclear power plant the problem involves complex transient twophase flow dynamics and fluidstructural loading processes a better understanding of this phenomenon will permit the development of improved design tools to ensure steam generator tube integrity the pressure and temperature were measured upstream and downstream of a sectional model of a tube bundle in crossflow and the transient tube loads were directly measured using dynamic piezoelectric load cells highspeed videos were taken to observe and better understand the flow phenomena causing the tube loading the working fluid was r134a and the tube bundle was a normal triangular array with a pitch ratio of 136 the flow through the bundle was choked for the majority of the transient the transient tube loading is explained in terms of the associated fluid mechanics an empirical model is developed that enables the prediction of the maximum tube loads once the pressure drop is known
this research examined how affective and cognitive responses to culture fusion a specific type of culture mixing that features the blending of different cultures or parts thereof into a new entity are influenced by individual differences in need for closure nfc two studies showed that individuals high vs low in nfc felt less favorable toward culture fusion ie the affective response both at an abstract level ie society structure models; study 1 n 191 and at a more concrete level ie food stimuli; study 2 n 257 in addition high nfc individuals tended to assign culturally fused stimuli to one discrete culture rather than acknowledging them as culturally hybrid ie the cognitive response furthermore mediation analyses showed that the relationships between nfc and responses toward culture fusion were mediated by rightwing authoritarianism these findings are interpreted in terms of the threat to epistemic security needs posed by culture fusion

the new edgedirected interpolation nedi algorithm is noniterative and orientation adaptive it achieves better edge performance in enhancing remote sensing images and natural images than conventional bilinear and bicubic methods it is also the theoretical foundation of many other complex regression and autoregression interpolation methods although nedi has impressive performance its computation complexity is an obstacle to largescale expansion parallel acceleration of nedi provides strong versatility and extensibility in this paper we propose a finegrained implementation for nedi using gpu in the finegrained approach we assign calculations of one unknown pixel to 2 x 2 2 x 4 and 4 x 4 threads using nvidia tesla k40c gpu for a case of asynchronous i/o transfer our gpu optimization efforts using finegrained nedi can achieve a speedup of 9909fold when considering the i/o transfer time compared with the original singlethreaded c cpu code with the o2 compiling optimization on intel core tm i7920 to demonstrate the effectiveness of our finegrained scheme we also compare the fine and coarsegrained schemes by interpolating a 720p video to 1440p adopting the finegrained scheme we can achieve realtime display the finegrained parallel mode can be expanded to other algorithms based on regression and autoregression schemes c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved
field observations of downslope bentonite erosion from a geosynthetic clay liner gcl covered by only a black geomembrane are reported for a composite liner left exposed without a protective soil cover for much longer than recommended by the gcl manufacturer a new nondestructive lighttransmission technique developed to investigate bentonite erosion features in the field is presented a classification system is developed to describe the type of erosion features observed results from five field investigations at the queen's university environmental liner test site quelts ii are reported to quantify the onset progression and severity of downslope erosion for one particular geotextileencased needlepunched gcl for exposure periods of between 7 weeks and 13 years the first significant erosion feature type e with bentonite loss narrower than 25 cm was observed after 6 months of exposure irrecoverable erosion features type ee with bentonite loss wider than 25 cm were observed after 12 months of exposure these findings highlight the need to follow the manufacturer's recommendations for timely covering of a composite liner with soil following liner installation
selective laser melting slm process an additive manufacturing am technology has had a rapid growth in the biomedical and aerospace markets because of the ability to manufacture complex designs directly from computeraided design cad using materials such as titanium and aluminum alloys although this technology allows designers to fabricate geometries not achievable with conventional manufacturing it has some restrictions the paper presents the technological problems and restrictions resulting in the production of structures in aluminum alloy by slm in particular it analyzed the input file of the process stl file and the dimensional limits of geometries with sharp edges as a simple parallelepiped with a square base since the understanding of the limitations can help the designer in the creation of new components the creation of functionindependent design rules easily transferrable on individual part designs could allow a wide industrial usage and a better knowledge of am technologies the results presented in this paper showed that the choice of parameters of conversion from the cad model to stl file could be a restriction for the software for preprocessing part but also affects the surface roughness moreover if a slm machine with a laser beam of 100 mu m is used it is not possible to produce geometries with sharp edges with size base below 08 mm in an aluminum alloy
cationic copolymer emulsions of st ba aa and gma were successfully synthesized via semicontinuous emulsion polymerization the properties of synthesized cationic emulsions were characterized by monomer conversion and solid content differential scanning calorimeter particle size and distribution zeta potential and centrifugal stability the film performance of the cationic emulsions formed on cotton fiber surface was observed by scanning electricity microscopy the influence of cationic emulsions on the color data k/s values and rubbing fastness of dyed cotton fabrics was also investigated the results show that p stbaaagma emulsion had larger particle size and higher zeta potential than p stbaaa emulsion when the films were formed at room temperature p stbaaagma emulsion film had better performance than p stbaaa emulsion film the addition of gma monomers improved the film performance p stbaaagma emulsion films formed at 120 degrees c after acetic acid solution treatment had the best water resistance dyed cotton fabrics pretreated with p stbaaagma emulsion had better pigment dyeing performance than those pretreated with p stbaaa emulsion it demonstrates that the addition of gma monomers further improved the effect of pigment dyeing for cotton fabrics with cationic emulsions as binders with the increase of p stbaaagma concentration the color performance of dye fabrics improved while the rubbing fastness decreased a little but the handle and fastness still meets the use standards for consumers c 2017 wiley periodicals inc
background: the transcription factor ets1 is highly expressed in b lymphocytes loss of ets1 leads to premature b cell differentiation into antibodysecreting cells ascs secretion of autoantibodies and development of autoimmune disease despite the importance of ets1 in b cell biology few ets1 target genes are known in these cells results: to obtain a more complete picture of the function of ets1 in regulating b cell differentiation we performed ets1 chipseq in primary mouse b cells to identify >10 000binding sites many of which were localized near genes that play important roles in b cell activation and differentiation although ets1 bound to many sites in the genome it was required for regulation of less than 5% of them as evidenced by gene expression changes in b cells lacking ets1 the cohort of genes whose expression was altered included numerous genes that have been associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility we focused our attention on four such ets1 target genes ptpn22 stat4 egr1 and prdm1 to assess how they might contribute to ets1 function in limiting asc formation we found that dysregulation of these particular targets cannot explain altered asc differentiation in the absence of ets1 conclusion: we have identified genomewide binding targets for ets1 in b cells and determined that a relatively small number of these putative target genes require ets1 for their normal expression interestingly a cohort of genes associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility is among those that are regulated by ets1 identification of the target genes of ets1 in b cells will help provide a clearer picture of how ets1 regulates b cell responses and how its loss promotes autoantibody secretion
background: cospeech gestures are part of nonverbal communication during conversations they either support the verbal message or provide the interlocutor with additional information furthermore they prompt as nonverbal cues the cooperative process of turn taking in the present study we investigated the influence of cospeech gestures on the perception of dyadic dialogue in aphasic patients in particular we analysed the impact of cospeech gestures on gaze direction towards speaker or listener and fixation of body parts we hypothesized that aphasic patients who are restricted in verbal comprehension adapt their visual exploration strategies methods: sixteen aphasic patients and 23 healthy control subjects participated in the study visual exploration behaviour was measured by means of a contactfree infrared eyetracker while subjects were watching videos depicting spontaneous dialogues between two individuals cumulative fixation duration and mean fixation duration were calculated for the factors cospeech gesture present and absent gaze direction to the speaker or to the listener and region of interest roi including hands face and body results: both aphasic patients and healthy controls mainly fixated the speaker's face we found a significant cospeech gesture x roi interaction indicating that the presence of a cospeech gesture encouraged subjects to look at the speaker further there was a significant gaze direction x roi x group interaction revealing that aphasic patients showed reduced cumulative fixation duration on the speaker's face compared to healthy controls conclusion: cospeech gestures guide the observer's attention towards the speaker the source of semantic input it is discussed whether an underlying semantic processing deficit or a deficit to integrate audiovisual information may cause aphasic patients to explore less the speaker's face c 2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

this paper focuses on the relationship between remotelysensed urban site characteristics uscs and land surface temperature lst particular emphasis is put on an extensive comparison of twodimensional 2d and threedimensional 3d uscs as potential indicators of the surface urban heat island uhi effect and as potential predictors for thermal sharpening applications both widelyused as well as more recently proposed metrics of the urban remote sensing literature are investigated within a single experiment while some of these uscs have already been used earlier others have never been analyzed before in the context of urban temperature studies in addition to the comparison of 2d and 3d usc5 the spatiotemporal dependencies of their relation to lst are examined to this end the experimental setup of this work includes two study areas 26 usc5 and 16 lst scenes covering four seasons use is made of a comprehensive database compiled for the cities of berlin and cologne germany after data preparation very high resolution vhr multispectral and height data are employed to map finescale urban land cover lc the resulting lc maps are then used in conjunction with the height information to compute 2d and 3d uscs subsequently multitemporal lst images are retrieved from landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus etm+ scenes the spatiotemporal investigation of the usclst connection constitutes the final stage of the workflow and is achieved in the framework of a dedicated correlation analysis the results of this study highlight that the linkage between uscs and lst sensed at small scan angles is not stronger when 3d parameters are considered even though they may offer more holistic representations of the urban landscape 3d uscs are consistently outperformed by some of the most widelyused 2d metrics the analysis of spatial dependencies reveals that the usclst interplay does not only differ between but also within the two test sites this is due to their distinct geographies with urban form and compactness green spaces and street trees and the structural composition of lc elements being some of the determining factors the examination of temporal dependencies yielded that the association between uscs and lst is fairly stable over time but can be subject to larger inter and intraseason variations for different reasons including the season of acquisition vegetation phonology and meteorological conditions since previous research was based on the analysis of a single study area a limited number of mainly 2d uscs and/or only a few lst scenes acquired in specific seasons it is concluded that the findings of this study provide researchers and practitioners with a more complete picture of the usclst relationship c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved
the smart home ambient intelligence and ambient assisted living have been intensively researched for decades although rural areas are an important potential market because they represent about 80% of the territory of the eu countries and around 125 million inhabitants there is currently a lack of applicable aal solutions this paper discusses the theoretical foundations of aal in rural areas this discussion is underlined by the achievements of the empirical field study casa vecchia which has been carried out over a fouryear period in a rural area in austria the major goal of casa vecchia was to evaluate the feasibility of a specific form of aal for rural areas: bringing aal technology to the homes of the elderly rather than moving seniors to specialequipped care facilities the casa vecchia project thoroughly investigated the possibilities challenges and drawbacks of aal related to this specific approach the findings are promising and somewhat surprising and indicate that further technical interactional and sociopsychological research is required to make aal in rural areas reasonable in the future
introduction the perception of a direct gaze that is of another individual's gaze directed at the observer that leads to eye contact is known to influence a wide range of cognitive processes and behaviors we stress that these effects mainly reflect positive impacts on human cognition and may thus be used as relevant tools for therapeutic purposes objectives in this review we aim 1 to provide an exhaustive review of eye contact effects while discussing the limits of the dominant models used to explain these effects 2 to illustrate the therapeutic potential of eye contact by targeting those pathologies that show both preserved gaze processing and deficits in one or several functions that are targeted by the eye contact effects and 3 to propose concrete ways in which eye contact could be employed as a therapeutic tool discussion 1 we regroup the variety of eye contact effects into four categories including memory effects activation of prosocial behavior positive appraisals of self and others and the enhancement of selfawareness we emphasize that the models proposed to account for these effects have a poor predictive value and that further descriptions of these effects is needed 2 we then emphasize that people with pathologies that affect memory social behavior and self and/or other appraisal and selfawareness could benefit from eye contact effects we focus on depression autism and alzheimer's disease to illustrate our proposal to our knowledge no anomaly of eye contact has been reported in depression patients suffering from alzheimer disease at the early and moderate stage have been shown to maintain a normal amount of eye contact with their interlocutor we take into account that autism is controversial regarding whether gaze processing is preserved or altered in the first view individuals are thought to elude or omit gazing at another's eyes while in the second individuals are considered to not be able to process the gaze of others we adopt the first stance following the view that people with autism are not interested in processing social signals such as gaze but could do so efficiently if properly motivated for each pathology we emphasize that eye contact could be used for example to enhance sensitivity to bodily states thus improving emotional decision making in autism ; to lead to more positive appraisal of the self and others in depression ; to improve memory performances in alzheimer disease and more generally to motivate the recipient to engage in the therapeutic process 3 finally we propose two concrete ways to employ eye contact effects as a therapeutic tool the first is to develop cognitivebehavioral tools to learn and/or motivate the recipient to create frequent and prolonged eye contact periods the second is to raise awareness among caregivers of the beneficial effects of eye contact and to teach them the way to use eye contact to reach its optimum effects future investigations are however needed to explore the ways in which eye contact effects can be efficiently integrated in therapeutic strategies as well as to identify the clinical populations that can benefit from such therapeutic interventions c 2016 l'encephale paris

polybenzoxazine coatings have been applied by spin coating of a solution prepared from a laboratory synthesized phenol paraphenylenediamine benzoxazine pppda on 1050 aluminum alloy a heat treatment was performed on the coating to polymerize the benzoxazine monomer by a ring opening mechanism attested for by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and followed by differential scanning calorimetry dsc dielectric analysis dea showed curing to proceed at a temperature range up to 230 degrees c without thermal decomposition taking place as has already been reported in the literature for commercial bisphenola benzoxazines baa the barrier protection has been evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis for 30 days in a sodium chloride solution 01 m the results were fitted with equivalent electrical circuits in order to understand the electrochemical behavior of such a system the initial barrier properties of both precursor and polymerized coatings appear to be excellent for coatings having a thickness of only 5 mu m though delamination occurs in the polymerized coating during saline tests after several days of immersion such kind of coatings have remarkable properties with respect to epoxy coatings as they show a high geometrical stability during curing and a very low water uptake during saline tests c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
the spinchange dynamics of a model with ultracold hyperfinespin1 atoms confined in an optical superlattice is discussed first the disturbance of the twosite dynamics by coupling the dimer to a spin1 ancilla is analyzed when the dimer is coupled to the ancilla even by a weak coupling the significant changes in the system's timeevolution processes are observed next we show that for the twoparticle case the total hyperfinespinsinglet state is generated by exploiting a quadratic zeeman shift with realistic values of the strength of external magnetic field and evolution period of time moreover even in a weak coupling regime the proper choice of the additional ancilladimer interaction results in generating the wave function which is characteristic of the homogeneous threesite ring in consequence such wave function exhibits translational invariance symmetry despite the strong asymmetry of the lattice furthermore we present our proposal for extracting various kinds of maximally entangled states mes for threesite spin1 systems starting from initial product states in particular we show that the type of generated mes can be unambiguously recognized by the measurement performed on the ancilla
a longterm goal of our field is to determine the sequence of pathological events which ultimately lead to cognitive decline and dementia in this study we first assessed the patterns of brain tau tangle accumulation measured with the positron emission tomography tracer f18av1451 associated with wellestablished alzheimer's disease factors in a cohort including cognitively healthy elderly individuals and individuals at early symptomatic stages of alzheimer's disease we then explored highly associated patterns of greater f18av1451 binding and increased annualized change in cortical amyloidbeta plaques measured as florbetapir positron emission tomography binding antecedent to f18av1451 positron emission tomography scans and to what extent these multimodal pattern associations explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures independently and jointly we found that: i f18av1451 positron emission tomography retention was differentially associated with age and crosssectional florbetapir positron emission tomography retention but not with years of education gender or apoe genotype; ii increased annualized change in florbetapir retention antecedent to f18av1451 positron emission tomography scans in the parietotemporal and precuneus brain regions was associated with greater f18av1451 pet retention most prominently in the inferior temporal and inferior parietal regions in the full cohort with florbetapir positive/negativeassociated variability; and iii this f18av1451 positron emission tomography retention pattern significantly explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures independent of the associated antecedent increased annualized change in florbetapir positron emission tomography retention these findings are in agreement with the pathology literature which suggests that tau tangles but not amyloidbeta plaques correlate with cognition and clinical symptoms furthermore nonlocal associations linking increased amyloidbeta accumulation rates with increased tau deposition are of great interest and support the idea that the amyloidbeta pathology might have remote effects in disease pathology spread potentially via the brain's intrinsic connectivity networks

the dark triad traits including narcissism machiavellianism and psychopathy are assumed to link to poor personal morality however an increasing number of studies suggested that narcissism was brighter than machiavellianism and psychopathy in a sample of chinese adolescents n 2828 relationships among the dark triad traits moral identity both internalization and symbolization and prosocial behavior were examined the results showed that narcissism was positively related to internalization symbolization and prosocial behavior whereas machiavellianism and psychopathy were negatively related to internalization and prosocial behavior but not related to symbolization further the positive links between narcissism and personal morality was moderated by selfesteem such that the links were weaker among high selfesteem individuals than low selfesteem ones these findings highlighted the bright but fragile side of narcissism and were discussed from cognitive and motivational perspectives c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
sociological social psychological and economic research on the nexus between socioeconomic status and prosociality has so far provided contradictory findings some studies suggest that actors with a high socioeconomic status act more egoistically than actors with a lower socioeconomic status other studies find the opposite to be true in contrast to previous research which has worked with onedimensional measures for socioeconomic status this study examines prosocial behavior among occupational groups that have regular reallife contact in their workspace about 150 hospital employees physicians nursing staff and nursing students participated in experiments on altruistic giving in dictator games the findings are surprisingly strong and clearcut: actors with higher social status act more prosocial than lowstatus actors furthermore we find hardly any ingroup effects which have been repeatedly postulated our findings support the claim that high status promotes prosocial behavior also they indicate that the inconclusive and in part contradictory findings provided by previous research stem to a considerable degree from deficient measures of social status and problematic experimental designs

great investment is made in the design and installation of stormwater control measures scms substantial research investment too is made to optimise the performance of scms however once installed scms often suffer from lack of maintenance or even outright neglect key maintenance needs for wet ponds constructed stormwater wetlands bioretention infiltration practices permeable pavement swales and rainwater harvesting systems are reviewed with many tasks such as the cleaning of pretreatment areas and the preservation of infiltration surfaces being common maintenance themes among scms consequences of lacking maintenance are illustrated mainly insufficient function or failure probable reasons for neglect include insufficient communication unclear responsibilities lack of knowledge financial barriers and decentralised measures in future designs and research maintenance and lack thereof should be considered assessing the performance of scms conservatively and including safety factors may prevent consequences of undermaintenance; and requiring regular inspection may help to enforce sufficient maintenance
this paper compares the hydraulics and 3d flow features of the ordinary rectangular and trapezoidal plan view piano key weirs pkws using two phase rans numerical simulations the main aim is to investigate effects of the inlet key area and angle of the side walls on discharge capacity of the pkw while keeping the developing length of the crest intact the numerical model has been used to carry out a sensitivity analysis for geometrical parameters and hydrodynamics of the rectangular and trapezoidal weirs tpkws have been compared for wide range of the water head on the weir results show that the trapezoidal weir has higher efficiency than the ordinary rectangular pkw this is partly related to the inlet key flow conditions the trapezoidal geometry increases the inlet flow area resulting in reduction of the velocity along the key axis consequently flow is distributed more uniformly over the side crests the gradual transition of the inlet key limits the development of the recirculation zones along the side walls and it also limits the formation of the critical section along the inlet key these phenomena result in increase of the effective weir length and thus discharge capacity increases in trapezoidal weir compared with rectangular one discretization of the discharge along the crest of the tested weirs clearly confirms these findings

in polar seas the seasonal melting of ice triggers the development of an openwater ecosystem characterized by shortlived algal blooms the grazing and development of zooplankton and the influx of avian and mammalian predators spatial heterogeneity in the timing of ice melt generates temporal variability in the development of these events across the habitat offering a natural framework to assess how foraging marine predators respond to the spring phenology we combined 4 yr of tracking data of antarctic petrels thalassoica antarctica with synoptic remotesensing data on sea ice and chlorophyll a to test how the development of melting ice and primary production drive antarctic petrel foraging crosscorrelation analyses of firstpassage time revealed that antarctic petrels utilized foraging areas with a spatial scale of 300 km these areas changed position or disappeared within 10 to 30 d and showed no spatial consistency among years generalized additive model gam analyses suggested that the presence of foraging areas was related to the time since ice melt antarctic petrels concentrated their search effort in melting areas and in areas that had reached an age of 50 to 60 d from the date of ice melt we found no significant relationship between search effort and chlorophyll a concentration we suggest that these foraging patterns were related to the vertical distribution and profitability of the main prey the antarctic krill euphausia superba our study demonstrates that the annual ice melt in the southern ocean shapes the development of a highly patchy and elusive food web underscoring the importance of flexible foraging strategies among top predators
we study supply function competition among conventional power generators with different levels of flexibility and the impact of intermittent renewable power generation on the competition inflexible generators commit production before uncertainties are realized whereas flexible generators can adjust their production after uncertainties are realized both types of generators compete in an electricity market by submitting supply functions to a system operator who solves a twostage stochastic program to determine the production level for each generator and the corresponding market prices we aim to gain an understanding of how conventional generators' in flexibility and renewable energy's intermittency affect the supply function competition and the market price we find that the classic supply function equilibrium model overestimates the intensity of the market competition and even more so when more intermittent generation is introduced into the system the policy of economically curtailing intermittent generation intensifies the market competition reduces price volatility and improves the system's overall efficiency furthermore these benefits of economic curtailment are most significant when the productionbased subsidies for renewable energy are absent

in this paper we propose a novel twostep building extraction method from remote sensing images by integrating saliency cue we first utilize classical features such as shadow color and shape to find out initial building candidates a fully connected conditional random field model is introduced in this step to ensure that most of the buildings are incorporated while it is hard to further remove the mislabled rooftops from the building candidates by only using classical features we adopt saliency cue as a new feature to determine whether there is a rooftop in each segmentation patch obtained from previous step the basic idea behind the use of saliency information is that rooftops are more likely to attract visual attention than surrounding objects based on a specifically designed saliency estimation algorithm for building object we extract saliency cue in the local region of each building candidate which is integrated into a probabilistic model to get the final building extraction result we show that the saliency cue can provide an efficient probabilistic indication of the presence of rooftops which helps to reduce false positives while without increasing false negatives at the same time experimental results on two benchmark datasets highlight the advantages of the integration of saliency cue and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the stateof theart methods

in water treatment flocculation creates aggregated particles or flocs large enough to be removed by downstream processes of sedimentation and filtration fluidized beds of flocs floc blankets are sometimes included in upflow sedimentation processes because they can significantly improve sedimentation tank particle removal when plate or tube settlers are used overall performance of a sedimentation tank containing a floc blanket is influenced by the characteristics of incoming flocs fromthe flocculator floc blankets provide an additional opportunity for aggregation of colloidal particles that enables a reduction in the size of the flocculators while improving particle removal efficiency in this study laminar flow flocculators varying in velocity gradient g and residence time theta were tested in a laboratory scale water treatment systemwith a floc blanket results indicate that increasing g range of 74251 s 1 while decreasing residence time from 269 to 80 s and maintaining a constant g theta similar to 20 000 improved particle removal these results indicate that velocity gradients greater than existing design recommendations may be used to reduce flocculator residence times and associated construction costs when upflow sedimentation with a floc blanket and overlying lamellar plate or tube settlers are employed subsequent to flocculation further reduction of the residence time to 24 s with a g of 251 s 1 resulted in a settled water turbidity of 14 nephelometric turbidity unit ntu when varying theta at a constant g of 72 s 1 an apparentminimum in settled effluent turbidity at 015 ntu was observed at the middle residence time tested theta 211 s suggesting that long hydraulic flocculator residence times may be suboptimal
uncertainty must be taken into account in all aspects of ambient intelligence and human decisions and activities we investigate how to utilize both probabilistic and possibilistic sources of information for use in humanized decisionmaking in particular we examine aspects of the possibilistic conditioning of probability developed by yager to provide bounding of the resulting probability analysis of the cases of completely certain and uncertain probability and possibility distribution are carried out additionally the cases of intermediate uncertainty and a general case of possibilities are analyzed the zadeh consistency measure is also used to assess these cases to consider whether the conditioned probability is more informative for decisionmaking three measures shannon entropy gini index and renyi entropy are used to compare the original probability distributions and the conditioned distribution for the cases described
a high degree of uncertainty associated with the emission inventory for china tends to degrade the performance of chemical transport models in predicting pm25 concentrations especially on a daily basis in this study a novel machine learning algorithm geographically weighted gradient boosting machine gwgbm was developed by improving gbm through building spatial smoothing kernels to weigh the loss function this modification addressed the spatial nonstationarity of the relationships between pm25 concentrations and predictor variables such as aerosol optical depth aod and meteorological conditions gwgbm also overcame the estimation bias of pm25 concentrations due to missing aod retrievals and thus potentially improved subsequent exposure analyses gwgbm showed good performance in predicting daily pm25 concentrations r2 076 rmse 230 g/m 3 even with partially missing aod data which was better than the original gbm model r2 071 rmse 253 g/m 3 on the basis of the continuous spatiotemporal prediction of pm25 concentrations it was predicted that 95% of the population lived in areas where the estimated annual mean pm25 concentration was higher than 35 g/m 3 and 45% of the population was exposed to pm25 >75 g/m 3 for over 100 days in 2014 gwgbm accurately predicted continuous daily pm25 concentrations in china for assessing acute human health effects c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
harvesting rainwater is a common practice worldwide particularly in areas with no access to a public water supply or insufficient groundwater reserves more than two million people living in semiarid regions of brazil consume rainwater stored in cisterns and little information is available regarding the water quality despite the initial good quality of the rainwater its harvest and storage can introduce contaminants that must be eliminated before consumption to evaluate the influence of handling cistern age and precipitation on the quality of harvested rainwater we monitored seven cisterns in the semiarid brazilian northeast over 4 years microbial and physicochemical parameters were monitored once a month and denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis dgge was performed at the end of the monitoring period coliform bacteria were detected in 100% of samples while escherichia coli were observed in 738% the alkalinity and conductivity were the highest for the recently built cisterns due to the dissolution of construction materials the dgge of the 16s r dna did not reveal the presence of e coli instead dgge bands sequencing indicated that species primarily affiliated with alphaproteobacteria were present in all cisterns indicating the presence of microbial ecosystems capable of purifying and stabilizing the stored rainwater
we previously demonstrated 2 statistically distinct factors of degeneration in alzheimer's disease: one strongly related to white matter damage and age interpreted asageand vascularrelated and the other related to cortical atrophy thought to representneurodegenerative changes associated with alzheimer's disease those factors are now replicated in a distinct crosssectional data set of 364 participants from the alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative and their interpretation is improved using correlations with csf biomarkers furthermore we now show that changes in both factors over 2 years are independently associated with decline in miniemental state examination score in a longitudinal subset of 116 individuals with mild cognitive impairment progression in theageand vascularrelated factor was greater for individuals with 2 apoe epsilon 4 alleles and linked to a greater attributable change in miniemental state examination than theneurodegenerative factor these results suggest benefits of targeting white matter and vascular health to complement interventions focused on the neurodegenerative aspect of the disease even in individuals with little discernable vascular comorbidity c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved

the stone column is a useful method for increasing the bearing capacity and reducing the settlements of foundations the confinement provided by the native soft soils has an effective influence on the stone column bearing capacity in this paper laboratory tests were performed on unreinforced and reinforced geotextileencased stone columns tests were performed on columns with diameters of 60 80 and 100 mm and a length to diameter ratio of 5 vertical encased stone columns vesc and horizontal reinforced stone columns hrsc were used for stone column reinforcement to investigate the effect of reinforcement type on the bearing capacity the main objective of this research is to study the efficiency of vesc and hrsc under the same conditions for diameters of 60 80 and 100 mm experimental results show that the bearing capacity of stone columns increases using vertical or horizontal reinforcing material moreover the bearing capacity of reinforced stone columns increases by increasing the strength of reinforcement in both vesc and hrsc results show that bulging failure mechanism governed in all tests and that lateral bulging decreases using geotextiles and increasing strength of reinforcement in addition for both vesc and hrsc the stress concentration ratio of the columns also increases
in digitally controlled circuits for power electronic circuits sampling data are important because the digital control circuit is operated on the basis of these data if the sampled values have been affected by switching noise from the power circuit the control stability of the circuit would be disturbed this paper proposes a noiseless sampling method that can sample a value without being affected by the switching noise the synchronous sampling method may be affected by the switching noise depending on the duty ratio of the circuit the noiseless sampling method does not obtain data immediately after turnon and turnoff switching the control circuit can avoid the switching noise by using noiseless sampling which leads to a disturbance in the control circuit and enhances the robustness of the circuit when applying the multisampling method experimental results are presented to verify that the current control of the proposed sampling method is not disturbed by the switching noise even in the absence of a noise filter
it is well established that transpiration and photosynthetic rates generally increase in resprouting shoots after fire in chaparral shrublands by contrast little is known about how plant hydraulic function varies during this same recovery period we hypothesized that vascular traits both functional and structural would also shift in order to support this heightened level of gas exchange and growth we examined stem xylemspecific hydraulic conductivity ks and resistance to cavitation p50 for eight chaparral shrub species as well as several potential xylem structural determinants of hydraulic function and compared established unburned plants and cooccurring postfire resprouting plants unburned plants were generally more resistant to cavitation than resprouting plants but the two groups did not differ in ks resprouting plants had altered vessel structure compared with unburned plants with resprouting plants having both wider diameter vessels and higher intervessel pit density for biomechanics unburned plants had both stronger and denser stem xylem tissue than resprouting plants shifts in hydraulic structure and function resulted in resprouting plants being more vulnerable to dehydration the interaction between time since disturbance ie resprouting versus established stands and drought may complicate attempts to predict mortality risk of resprouting plants it is well established that transpiration and photosynthetic rates generally increase in resprouting plants after fire in chaparral shrublands but little is known about how plant hydraulic function varies during this same recovery period the ecophysiology of eight species of chaparral shrubs was compared between resprouting plants and adjacent unburned plants resprouting plants varied from unburned plants in their hydraulics xylem structure and biomechanics the observed shifts resulted in resprouting plants being more vulnerable to dehydration than unburned plants and demonstrate potential variability of plants in their hydraulic physiology depending on disturbance recovery state
an anomalously slight glacier mass gain during 2000 to the 2010s has recently been reported in the karakoram region however to date no investigations of the regionwide glacier mass balance in the karakoram prior to 2000 have been reported leaving a knowledge gap for assessing glacier responses to climate change we calculated elevation and mass change using dems generated from kh9 images acquired during 19731980 and the 1 arcsecond srtm dem we find a slight mass loss of 009 +/ 003 m we a 1 12 366 km 2 for 19732000 which is less negative than the global average rate for 19712009 031 +/ 019 m we a 1 within the karakoram the glacier change patterns are spatially and temporally heterogeneous in particular a nearly stable state in the central karakoram 004 +/ 005 m we a 1 during the period 19742000 implies that the karakoram anomaly dates back to the 1970s combined with the previous studies we conclude that the karakoram glaciers as a whole were in a nearly balanced state during the 1970s to the 2010s

background: children with reactive attachment disorder rad have serious sociobehavioral problems and often rely on socially abnormal aggressive and manipulative forms of communication little is known however about the influence of teachers on the sociobehavioral development of children with symptoms of rad aims: this longitudinal study examined the influence of teacher sensitivity on the sociobehavioral development of children with symptoms of rad across one school year method: the sample included 85 belgian children and 70 teachers from special education schools in the previous school year teachers rated inhibited and disinhibited rad symptoms in the next school year teacher sensitivity was observed in interactions with individual children in the first trimester teacherrated overt aggression relational aggression and prosocial behavior was assessed in the first second and third trimester results: we found no effects of sensitivity on prosocial behavior also no effects were found for children with disinhibited rad symptoms for children with inhibited rad symptoms increases in overt and relational aggression were observed when sensitivity was low whereas decreases were observed when sensitivity was high conclusions and implications: the results suggest that teacher sensitivity is associated with the sociobehavioral development of children with inhibited rad symptoms but not with the sociobehavioral development of children with disinhibited rad symptoms what this paper adds: children with reactive attachment disorder rad exhibit sociobehavioral problems that hinder their school adjustment these sociobehavioral problems appear relatively stable and it is not known what influence special education teachers might have on the development of these problems across a school year this study suggests that teacher sensitivity is associated with changes in the sociobehavioral development of children with inhibited rad symptoms whereas high sensitivity was associated with improvements low sensitivity appeared to exaggerate the sociobehavioral problems of these children as children with inhibited rad symptoms have difficulties communicating their needs and wishes in socially adaptive ways it may not be easy for teachers to understand these children teachers may misinterpret a child's behavior and consequently will fail to respond to the child's underlying needs this may reinforce the child's sociobehavioral problems and increase the child's reliance on egocentric and aggressive means in interactions with others this study therefore highlights the need to support teachers in interactions with children with inhibited rad symptoms in order to help them understand how the children's observable behaviors in the classroom may convey their underlying socioemotional needs and how they can respond to these needs importantly teacher sensitivity was not associated with the sociobehavioral development of children with disinhibited rad symptoms eg indiscriminate friendliness consistent with previous research this study suggests that children with inhibited rad symptoms are more susceptible to the quality of the caregiving environment than children with disinhibited rad symptoms and extends this finding to the school context c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
a rainwater harvesting system rhs was designed for a waste treatment facility located near the town of mirandela northern portugal to be used in the washing of vehicles and other equipment the cleaning of outside concrete or asphalt floors and the watering of green areas water tank volumes representing 100% efficiency vr were calculated by the ripple method with different results depending on two consumption scenarios adopted for irrigation the rhs design was based on a precipitation record spanning a rather long period 3 decades the calculated storage capacities fulfilled the water demand even when prolonged droughts occurred during that timeframe however because the drought events have been rather scarce the vr values were considered oversized and replaced by optimal volumes notwithstanding the new volumes were solely half of the original vr values the projected rhs efficiency remained very high around 90% while the probability of system failure efficiency < 100% stayed very low in the order of 5% in both scenarios the economic savings related to the optimization of vr were noteworthy while the investment's return periods decreased substantially from the original to the optimized solutions a high efficiency with a low storage capacity is typical of low demanding applications of rainwater harvesting where water availability vw largely exceeds water demand cw that is to say where demand fractions cw/vw are very low based on the results of a literature review covering an ample geographic distribution and describing a very large number of demand fraction scenarios a cw/vw 08 was defined as the threshold to generally distinguish the low from the high demanding rhs applications c 2015 elsevier bv all rights reserved

reverse genetics techniques are powerful tools for studying gene functions in the model diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum rnaimediated knockdown of genes still is the most commonly used reverse genetics technique due to the diploidic life cycle missing reproduction in lab cultures many commonly used techniques to create knockout instead of knockdown lines are not applicable in p tricornutum these limitations can be overcome by using genome editing approaches like talen transcription activatorlike effector nucleases and/or crispr/cas9 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats allowing the introduction of targeted mutagenesis events both techniques have recently been adapted exemplarily for diatoms however no concise guidelines exist yet for routine utilization of these tools and the subsequent characterization of the mutants we therefore have adapted a costeffective talen generation system previously established for mammalian cells for the use in p tricornutum allowing the assembly of talens in about twoweeks we further provide protocols for: a choosing a talen target site in order to avoid potentially ineffective and/ or offtarget prone talen constructs b efficient transformation of p tricornutum with both talen constructs utilizing two antibiotics resistance markers c effective screening of the transformants in order to test our system we chose the bluelight dependent transcription factor aureochrome1a ptaureo1a as a target gene due to the known phenotype of previously characterized p tricornutum rnai knockdown strains our talen approach appears to be highly efficient: targeted mutation events were detected in 50% of all transformants obtained whereas 21% of the transformants were found to be biallelic knockout lines furthermore most talen transformed cell lines were found to be genetically homogeneous without the need for replating which greatly facilitates the screening process c 2017 elsevier b v all rights reserved
across six studies we examine how the magnitude of expressed happiness influences social perception and interpersonal behavior we find that happiness evokes different judgments when expressed at high levels than when expressed at moderate levels and that these judgments influence opportunistic behavior specifically people perceive very happy individuals to be more naive than moderately happy individuals these perceptions reflect the belief that very happy individuals shelter themselves from negative information about the world as a result of these inferences very happy people relative to moderately happy people are more likely to receive biased advice from advisors with a conflict of interest and are more likely to be chosen as negotiation partners when the opportunity for exploitation is salient our findings challenge existing assumptions in organizational behavior and psychology by identifying a significant disadvantage of expressing happiness and underscore the importance of examining emotional expressions at different magnitudes we call for future work to explore how the same emotion experienced or expressed at different levels influences judgment and behavior c 2016 published by elsevier inc

the thiem equation of radial groundwater flow to a well is more than 100 years old and is still commonly used here deviations caused by some of its simplifications are quantified by comparing the analytical to a numerical model that allows the implementation of more complex geometries the assumption of horizontal flow in the thiem equation which necessitates uniform inflow over the entire screen length of the fully penetrating well was found to cause deviations from actual pumping wells where the pump is placed above the screen resulting in nonuniform inflow and additional drawdown the same applies to partially penetrating wells where inflow peaks and additional drawdown occur especially when the well is screened in the lower part of the aquifer the use of the thiem equation in the nearfield of a well should thus be restricted to situations where the screen inflow is relatively uniformly distributed eg when it covers large portions of the aquifer thickness the presence of a gravel pack and a background gradient on the other hand are of limited importance

extracting the underlying lowdimensional space where highdimensional signals often reside has been at the center of numerous algorithms in the signal processing and machine learning literature during the past few decades moreover working with incomplete large scale datasets has recently been commonplace for diverse reasons this so called big data era we are currently living calls for devising online subspace learning algorithms that can suitably handle incomplete data their anticipated goal is to recursively estimate the unknown subspace by processing streaming data sequentially thus reducing computational complexity in this paper an online variational bayes subspace learning algorithm from partial observations is presented to account for the unawareness of the true rank of the subspace commonly met in practice lowrankness is explicitly imposed on the sought subspace data matrix by exploiting sparse bayesian learning principles sparsity simultaneously to lowrankness is favored on the subspace matrix by the sophisticated hierarchical bayesian scheme that is adopted the proposed algorithm is thus adept in dealing with applications whereby the underlying subspace may be also sparse the new subspace tracking scheme outperforms its stateoftheart counterparts in terms of estimation accuracy in a variety of experiments conducted on both simulated and real data c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved
geosynthetic clay liners gcls have been widely used as a hydraulic barrier along with hdpe geomembrane gm in landfills both the internal and interface strengths of gcls are very important for evaluating landfill stability an improved simple shear apparatus used in this study does not force the shear failure to occur along a predetermined plane the composite specimens can fail along any interface or through shearing of the gcl internally the displacement of each component of the specimen can also be measured during the tests when nonwoven geotextile side contacts textured gm nwgt/gmx and woven geotextile side contacts compacted clay layer wgt/ccl for a dry gcl the failure interface can change from nwgt/gmx interface to wgt/ccl interface with the increases of the normal stresses conversely when woven geotextile side contacts textured gm wgt/gmx and nonwoven geotextile side contacts compacted clay layer nwgt/ccl for a dry gcl the failure always occurs at the wgt/gmx interface for all applied normal stresses the internal failure of the gcl did not occur when the normal stress increased up to 1 500 kpa for the gcl in dry condition
rockdetention structures are used as restoration treatments to engineer ephemeral stream channels of southeast arizona usa to reduce streamflow velocity limit erosion retain sediment and promote surfacewater infiltration structures are intended to aggrade incised stream channels yet little quantified evidence of efficacy is available the goal of this 3year study was to characterize the geomorphic impacts of rockdetention structures used as a restoration strategy and develop a methodology to predict the associated changes we studied reaches of two ephemeral streams with different watershed management histories: one where thousands of looserock check dams were installed 30 years prior to our study and one with structures constructed at the beginning of our study the methods used included runoff sediment transport and geomorphic modelling and repeat terrestrial laser scanner tls surveys to map landscape change where discharge data were not available eventbased runoff was estimated using kineros2 a onedimensional kinematicwave runoff and erosion model discharge measurements and estimates were used as input to a twodimensional unsteady flowandsedimentation model nays2dh that combined a gridded flow transport and bed and bank simulation with geomorphic change through comparison of consecutive dems the potential to substitute uncalibrated models to analyze stream restoration is introduced we demonstrate a new approach to assess hydraulics and associated patterns of aggradation and degradation resulting from the construction of checkdams and other transverse structures notably we find that stream restoration using rockdetention structures is effective across vastly different timescales published by elsevier bv
the desensitization degree of emulsion explosives ee was calculated with the peak pressure of explosion shock waves tested in water to an explosive the less the desensitization degree the better the compression resistance so the compression resistance of an explosive can be compared and analyzed quantificationally with the desensitization degree the influence of an emulsifier on the pressure desensitization of ee was studied including the content and category of emulsifiers three kinds of emulsifiers span80 compound emulsifier and t152 were used in the tests the experimental results show that both the content and category of emulsifiers make a great effect oil the pressure desensitization of ee the desensitization degree of ee reduces with the emulsifier content being increased but there is an optimal content of an emulsifier for the compression resistance of ee while the content of span80 reaches 4wt% the desensitization degree of ee becomes a minimal value and augments somewhat if the emulsifier content is increased more that is to say the compression resistance of ee becomes the highest while the content of span80 is 4wt% and the compression resistance will decline if the content of span80 is increased more the compression resistance of the explosive emulsified by compound emulsifier is the hihest among all the explosives when the content of the whole components and manufacturing engineering are kept invariable

since the cost of rareearth permanent magnets pms such as ndfeb and smco is more and more increasing there is a great interest in designing pm machines without adopting such rareearth pms ie replacing them with cheaper ferrite magnets referring to the interior pm ipm machines the expected performance reduction is limited owing to the anisotropic structure: the reluctance rel torque component compensates for the use of lowenergy pms this paper investigates the convenience of adopting ferrite magnets in an ipm machine sometimes also referred to as pmassisted synchronous rel machine instead of a rareearth surfacemounted pm machine it is shown that even though a lengthening of the stack length is required the anisotropic pm machine that adopts ferrite magnets may represent a valid competitor of a surface pm machine with rareearth pms
we consider the problem of allocating the cost of a transmission system among load and generator entities it is a known instance of the classical cooperative game theoretic problem to solve this problem is a formidable task as we are dealing with a combinatorial game with transferable utilities this is an np hard problem therefore it suffers from the curse of dimensionality marginal pricing is a pragmatic alternative to solve this problem since both kirchhoff current law and voltage law are strictly adhered to however the generic complexity of cooperative game theoretic problems cannot be just wished away it now manifests as the difficulty in choosing an economic slack bus which may even be dispersed we propose the application of minmax fairness policy to solve this problem and give an algorithm which will run in polynomial time during network cost allocation minmax fairness policy minimizes the maximum regret among participating entities at each step maximum regret is measured in terms of price and lexicographic application of this principle leads to a fair and unique equilibrium price vector results on a large network demonstrate fairness as well as tractability of the proposed approach
research in evolutionary psychology and life history theory in particular has yielded important insights into the developmental processes that underpin variation in growth psychological functioning and behavioral outcomes across individuals yet there are methodological concerns that limit the ability to draw causal inferences about human development and psychological functioning within a life history framework the current study used a simulationbased modeling approach to estimate the degree of genetic confounding in tests of a wellresearched life history hypothesis: that father absence x is associated with earlier age at menarche y the results demonstrate that the genetic correlation between x and y can confound the phenotypic association between the two variables even if the genetic correlation is small suggesting that failure to control for the genetic correlation between x and y could produce a spurious phenotypic correlation we discuss the implications of these results for research on human life history and highlight the utility of incorporating genetically sensitive tests into future life history research c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
supporting learners affectively while carrying out stressful educational activities is an open research issue it requires the appropriate infrastructure for recognizing emotional states and reacting accordingly in runtime in this paper we describe the open platform that we have implemented named aicarp v2 to detect changes in physiological signals that can be associated with stressful situations and when this happens it recommends the learner to relax by delivering modulated sensorial support in terms of light sound or vibration at a relaxation breath rate in this way by taking advantage of ambient intelligence the learner can perceive the recommended action without interrupting the learning activity in this case practicing the oral exam of a second language the signal acquisition of the system which combines sensors from libellium ehealth platform with others integrated ad hoc has been compared with a commercial system j&j engineering i330c2 obtaining similar outcomes as to identifying significant changes in the physiological signals when the learner experiments an emotional reaction however the cost of aicarp v2 is much lower and at the same time it is open hardware and flexible and thus has the advantage of providing runtime data processing user studies have served to evaluate participants' perception of the sensorial support as well as to calibrate the delivery rule and to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided to them

computer aided process planning capp is an important bridge between computer aided design cad and computer aided manufacturing cam in computer integrated manufacturing environment operation sequence generation is one of the most difficult tasks in capp the aim of operation sequencing in capp is to determine the best order of machining operations with minimal manufacturing cost while satisfying all the precedence constraints this paper presents a proposed method for optimizing operation sequence using modified clustering algorithm the key concept of method is that the precedence constraints are firstly checked for selecting all possible next operations of the last operation in the sequence and their traveling costs are compared to choose the optimal feasible operation which has the minimum traveling cost in the sequence then all operation sequences are calculated the total traveling cost for obtaining the optimal sequence result because of removing all unfeasible sequences at the beginning of procedure and selecting the optimal operation into sequence in each step the time can be significantly reduced the capability and performance of the proposed method are demonstrated in three specific case studies the comparisons show that the proposed method can solve the problem in much lesser computational time while generating more alternate optimal feasible sequences than previous algorithms
change detection is one of the most important applications of remote sensing technology it is a challenging task due to the obvious variations in the radiometric value of spectral signature and the limited capability of utilizing spectral information in this paper an improved sparse coding method for change detection is proposed the intuition of the proposed method is that unchanged pixels in different images can be well reconstructed by the joint dictionary which corresponds to knowledge of unchanged pixels while changed pixels cannot first a query image pair is projected onto the joint dictionary to constitute the knowledge of unchanged pixels then reconstruction error is obtained to discriminate between the changed and unchanged pixels in the different images to select the proper thresholds for determining changed regions an automatic threshold selection strategy is presented by minimizing the reconstruction errors of the changed pixels adequate experiments on multispectral data have been tested and the experimental results compared with the state of the art methods prove the superiority of the proposed method contributions of the proposed method can be summarized as follows: 1 joint dictionary learning is proposed to explore the intrinsic information of different images for change detection in this case change detection can be transformed as a sparse representation problem to the authors' knowledge few publications utilize joint learning dictionary in change detection; 2 an automatic threshold selection strategy is presented which minimizes the reconstruction errors of the changed pixels without the prior assumption of the spectral signature as a result the threshold value provided by the proposed method can adapt to different data due to the characteristic of joint dictionary learning; and 3 the proposed method makes no prior assumption of the modeling and the handling of the spectral signature which can be adapted to different data
background and aims in vascular plants important questions regarding phloem function remain unanswered due to problems with invasive experimental procedures in this highly sensitive tissue certain brown algae kelps; laminariales also possess sieve tubes for photoassimilate transport but these are embedded in large volumes of a gelatinous extracellular matrix which isolates them from neighbouring cells therefore we hypothesized that kelp sieve tubes might tolerate invasive experimentation better than their analogues in higher plants and sought to establish nereocystis luetkeana as an experimental system methods the predominant localization of cellulose and the gelatinous extracellular matrix in n luetkeana was verified using specific fluorescent markers and confocal laser scanning microscopy sieve tubes in intact specimens were loaded with fluorescent dyes either passively carboxyfluorescein diacetate; cfda or by microinjection rhodamine b and the movement of the dyes was monitored by fluorescence microscopy key results application of cfda demonstrated source to sink bulk flow in n luetkeana sieve tubes and revealed the complexity of sieve tube structure with branches junctions and lateral connections microinjection into sieve elements proved comparatively easy pulsed rhodamine b injection enabled the determination of flow velocity in individual sieve elements and the direct visualization of pressureinduced reversals of flow direction across sieve plates conclusions the reversal of flow direction across sieve plates by pressurizing the downstream sieve element conclusively demonstrates that a critical requirement of the munch theory is satisfied in kelp; no such evidence exists for tracheophytes because of the high tolerance of its sieve elements to experimental manipulation n luetkeana is a promising alternative to vascular plants for studying the fluid mechanics of sieve tube networks

in mammals the suprachiasmatic nucleus scn of the hypothalamus is the site of the main circadian clock synchronized by the lightdark cycle which generates behavioral rhythms like feeding drinking and activity notwithstanding the main role of the scn clock on the control of all circadian rhythms has been questioned due to the presence of clock activity in many brain areas including those implicated in the regulation of feeding and reward moreover whether circadian rhythms of particular motivated behaviors exist is unknown here we evaluated the spontaneous daily and circadian behavior of consumption of a sweet caloric solution 510% sucrose and the effects of sucrose intake on the expression of clock genes in the mouse brain mice showed a daily in a lightdark cycle and a circadian in constant darkness conditions rhythm in the intake and sucrose preference with a rise for both parameters at night or subjective night in addition we observed changes in the circadian daynight expression of the clock gene per2 in the scn cortex and striatum of animals ingesting sucrose compared to control mice on pure water finally daily rhythms of sucrose intake and preference were abolished in per2 brdm1 and double per1 / per2 brdm1 mutant animals these data indicate that the expression of circadian rhythms of hedonic feeding behaviors may be controlled by brain circadian clocks and per gene expression c 2017 ibro published by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
attentiondeficit hyperactive disorder adhd is one of the most common mental health disorders amongst schoolaged children with an estimated prevalence of 5% in the global population american psychiatric association 2013 stimulants particularly methylphenidate mph are the firstline option in the treatment of adhd reeves and schweitzer 2004; dopheide and pliszka 2009 and are prescribed to an increasing number of children and adolescents in the us and the uk every year safer et al 1996; mccarthy et al 2009 though recent studies suggest that this is tailing off eg holden et al 2013 around 70% of children demonstrate a clinically significant treatment response to stimulant medication spencer et al 1996; schachter et al 2001; swanson et al 2001; barbaresi et al 2006 however it is unclear which patient characteristics may moderate treatment effectiveness as such most existing research has focused on investigating univariate or multivariate correlations between a set of patient characteristics and the treatment outcome with respect to dosage of one or several types of medication the results of such studies are often contradictory and inconclusive due to a combination of small sample sizes lowquality data or a lack of available information on covariates in this paper feature extraction techniques such as latent trait analysis were applied to reduce the dimension of on a large dataset of patient characteristics including the responses to symptombased questionnaires developmental health factors demographic variables such as age and gender and socioeconomic factors such as parental income we introduce a bayesian modeling approach in a learning in the model space framework that combines existing knowledge in the literature on factors that may potentially affect treatment response with constraints imposed by a treatment response model the model is personalized such that the variability among subjects is accounted for by a set of subjectspecific parameters for remission classification this approach compares favorably with conventional methods such as support vector machines and mixed effect models on a range of performance measures for instance the proposed approach achieved an area under receiver operator characteristic curve of 8284% compared to 7577% obtained from conventional regression or machine learning learning in the data space methods
reading other people's eyes is a valuable skill during interpersonal interaction although a number of studies have investigated visual patterns in relation to the perceiver's interest intentions and goals little is known about eye gaze when it comes to differentiating intentions to love from intentions to lust sexual desire to address this question we conducted two experiments: one testing whether the visual pattern related to the perception of love differs from that related to lust and one testing whether the visual pattern related to the expression of love differs from that related to lust our results show that a person's eye gaze shifts as a function of his or her goal love vs lust when looking at a visual stimulus such identification of distinct visual patterns for love and lust could have theoretical and clinical importance in couples therapy when these two phenomena are difficult to disentangle from one another on the basis of patients' selfreports

the 2015 release of the precipitation climatology from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc for 19512000 based on climatological normals of about 75 100 rain gauges allows for quantification of mean land surface precipitation as part of the global water cycle in gpcc's 2011release a bulk climatological correction was applied to compensate for gauge undercatch in this paper we derive an improved correction approach based on the synoptic weather reports for the period 19822015 the compared results show that the climatological approach tends to overestimate the correction for central and eastern europe especially in the northern winter and in other regions throughout the year applying the mean weatherdependent correction to the gpcc's uncorrected precipitation climatology for 19512000 gives a value of 8547 mm of precipitation per year excluding antarctica or 790 mm for the global land surface the warming of nearly 1 k relative to preindustrial temperatures is expected to be accompanied by a 2%3% increase in global land and ocean precipitation however a comparison of climatology for 30year reference periods from 19311960 up to 19812010 reveals no significant trend for land surface precipitation this may be caused by the large variability of precipitation the varying data coverage over time and other issues related to the sampling of raingauge networks the gpcc continues to enlarge and further improve the quality of its database and will generate precipitation analyses with homogeneous data coverage over time another way to reduce the sampling issues is the combination of rain gaugebased analyses with remote sensing ie satellite or radar datasets
while all cloud based platforms possess security vulnerabilities the additional security challenges with container systems stem from the sharing of host os among independent containers if a malicious application was to break into the root of container daemon it could gain root access into the host kernel thereby compromising the entire system it could create denialofservice attack for other user applications rejecting service to other applications in this paper we propose a quantum network security framework for the cloud we devise a means by which quantum particles denoted entangled bell pairs are routed to network nodes this enables teleportation of quantum information between source and destination only when root privileges are required by an application the secure quantum channel works on a useonce only policy so the key data cannot be easily copied regenerated or spoofed without detection a network framework for multiple prestaged channels is devised and we illustrate that policy for network routing of entangle particles formulated as a multitenant teleportation network capable of disseminating key data to servers hosting docker container applications the framework can achieve provably high levels of security and is capable of integration into a cloud data center for securing applications using docker containers we also describe quantum network layer protocols for cloud container security that leverage the unique properties of quantum entanglement to resolve security concerns this layer would control access between application and container daemon thereby facilitating restricted communication with proper authentication
scholars have argued that opposition to welfare is in part driven by stereotypes of african americans this argument assumes that when individuals think about welfare they spontaneously think about black recipients we investigated people's mental representations of welfare recipients in studies 1 and 2 we used a perceptual task to visually estimate participants' mental representations of welfare recipients compared with the average nonwelfarerecipient image the average welfarerecipient image was perceived by a separate sample as more african american and more representative of stereotypes associated with welfare recipients and african americans in study 3 participants were asked to determine whether they supported giving welfare benefits to the people pictured in the average welfarerecipient and nonwelfarerecipient images generated in study 2 participants were less supportive of giving welfare benefits to the person shown in the welfarerecipient image than to the person shown in the nonwelfarerecipient image the results suggest that mental images of welfare recipients may bias attitudes toward welfare policies

facilitating fish passage in fragmented river systems has commonly focused on commercially important migratory species eg salmonids increasingly ecosystembased approaches to river rehabilitation are being adopted and fishways are progressively being designed for fish assemblages estuarine barriers to fish movement have received less attention than riverine barriers in regards to refinement of fish passage this study evaluated fish passage at a pair of hydraulically distinct verticalslot fishways large vertical slot: max velocity 20 m s 1 max turbulence 95 w m 3 discharge 036 m3 s 1 ; small verticalslot: max velocity 10 m s 1 max turbulence 26 w m3 discharge 003 m3 s 1 on a lowlevel 10 m estuarine barrier at the terminus of the river murray australia over 32 pairedday samples of the fishway entrances and exits 291 483 fish 19 species were sampled from the large verticalslot compared to 183 659 fish 19 species from the small verticalslot smallbodied fish 96% and largebodied species were rare at both fishways species composition was similar but speciesspecific abundances varied widely between fishways the large verticalslot successfully passed a broad range of species and sizes but the passage of several smallbodied <100mm in length species was partially obstructed whilst passage efficiency was high for all species that entered the small verticalslot fishway variation in head differential and subsequently fishway hydraulics influenced the number of fish sampled at the entrance of the small verticalslot and the number of fish sampled at the exit of the large vertical slot in unison however the fishways facilitated the passage of a diverse migratory fish assemblage across the range of head differential experienced suggesting the application of paired verticalslot fishways with differing hydraulic characteristics is likely a viable approach at other lowlevel estuarine barriers c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
aim: mentalhealthrelated stigma affects helpseeking behavior and service utilization among young people whether mentalhealthrelated stigma is different or correlated between parents and their children is unknown it is also unknown whether the name change of schizophrenia in 2002 has had longterm effects on reducing stigma for adults in the general population methods: we recruited 143 parentchild pairs mean ages sd : 515 36 and 212 12 years respectively to complete selfreport questionnaires regarding mentalhealthrelated stigma and experience we also assessed negative stereotypes for three psychiatric disease names old and new names of schizophrenia and depression and for diabetes mellitus as a physical illness comparison the questionnaires also asked respondents to identify the old and new names of schizophrenia and dementia respectively among 10 names for mental and physical illnesses and conditions results: parents showed lower stigma levels toward mental illness and diabetes mellitus but similar or greater stigma levels toward schizophrenia compared with their children stigma levels toward mental illness in parents and their children were significantly correlated the rate of correct identification of the old and new names for schizophrenia was higher in parents than in their children 647% vs 414% p < 0001 parents who responded correctly endorsed more negative stereotypes toward the new name of schizophrenia compared with those who responded incorrectly p 0049 conclusion: the present findings suggest that stigma toward mental illness is shared between family members and the name change of schizophrenia has effectively reduced stigma levels toward this disorder in adults of various ages
purpose: besides ventricular parameters the design and angular orientation of a prosthetic heart valve induce a specific flow field the aim of this study was to know the inflow characteristics of a left ventricular model lvm investigating the behavior of tricuspid bioprosthetic mitral valves in terms of velocity profiles and related valve aperture areas at the beginning of diastole under different conditions methods: 3 heart rates hrs were established in the lvm and each mitral bioprosthesis 27 and 31 mm diameter was installed in 2 orientations rotated by 180 degrees for each experimental setup 2dimensional particle image velocimetry 2d piv measurements and simultaneous mitral valve mv area detection were obtained from 50 samples results: the results from the velocity profiles immediately downstream of mitral bioprostheses showed the influence of valve orientation for moderate hrs although for a similar magnitude of mean velocity vectors the geometries of mv open areas for each hr were similar regardless of valve orientation except for the 27mm valve at 90 beats per minute bpm and for the 31mm valve at 60 bpm moreover for each hr similar percentages of valve open area were obtained regardless of mv nominal diameters conclusions: in conclusion the experimental setup for the 2d piv measurements synchronized with the mv area detection was a useful tool for knowing the inflow characteristics of the lvm
changes in global climate drivers have multiple impacts on lake ecosystems as rain and wind conditions control catchment surface runoff and lake mixing regimes however human activities in lakes and their watersheds may have direct and indirect impacts on aquatic optical properties therefore identifying key drivers that can be controlled human from those that cannot climate represents an important objective in the present study we develop an algorithm to estimate the concentrations of suspended particulate matter spm in lake hongze the fourth largest freshwater lake in china using modis/aqua images with concurrent data collected from six cruise surveys the algorithm resulted in root mean square errors rmses of 764786 mg/l for spm ranging from 10 to 80 mg/l the algorithm was applied to 1602 cloudfree modis/aqua images from 2002 to 2015 our results show: 1 interannual and seasonal variations of spm concentrations in lake hongze are divided into two distinct periods between 2002 and 2011 and 20122015 with the transition associated to intensive dredging activities that were initiated in 2012 2 spm concentrations exhibit four typical patterns of spatial distribution which depend on local meteorological wind speed and wind direction and hydrological conditions catchment rainfall and huai river flowrate based on these results a new spatial zoning of the lake is derived to support government and agency monitoring the study shows additive and synergistic effects of climate change and human activities on spm concentrations over short and long timescales and the possibility to monitor these changes by remote sensing in shallow optically complex lakes c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved

microglia have undergone extensive characterization and have been shown to present distinct phenotypes such as the m1 or m2 phenotypes depending on their stimuli as a highly specific neurotoxin 6hydroxydopamine 6ohda can be used to further our understanding of the immune response in parkinson's disease pd dexmedetomidine dex a centrally selective alpha 2adrenoceptor agonist performs very well as an antianxiety medication sedative and analgesic in the present study we investigated the effects of dex on 6ohdainduced microglial polarization our results indicate that treatment with 6ohda promotes microglial polarization toward the m1 state in bv2 microglia cells by increasing the release of interleukin il 6 il1 beta or tumor necrosis factoralpha which can be prevented by pretreatment with dex in addition we found that 6ohda blocked il4mediated microglial m2 polarization by suppressing expression of the microglial m2 markers arginase1 arg1 resistinlike alpha retnla/fizz1 and chitinase 3like 3 chi3l3/ym1 which could be ameliorated by pretreatment with dex notably the inhibitory effects of 6ohda on il4mediated induction of the antiinflammatory marker genes il10 il13 and transforming growth factorbeta 2 could be significantly alleviated by pretreatment with dex in a dosedependent manner p < 001 mechanistically alternations in the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 were involved in this process these findings suggest that administration of dex has the potential to interrupt the process of microgliosis in pd
a test cover comprised of three different needlepunched geosynthetic clay liner gcl products and covered with up to 1 m of cover soil gravelly sand was built over arsenicrich tailings at a former gold mine in nova scotia canada to evaluate the performance of the gcls under local climatic conditions of the gcls examined one had untreated and two had polymerenhanced natural sodium bentonite the three gcls each had different carriers: one with a woven geotextile one with a scrimreinforced nonwoven geotextile and one with a woven geotextile laminated with a polypropylene film at some locations each type of gcl was placed in direct contact with the tailings at other locations each gcl was separated from the tailings by 015 m of cover soil samples of each gcl tailings and cover soil were recovered 1 and 2 years after construction tests show that the gcl with untreated bentonite maintained a low hydraulic conductivity 07 m of cover soil above the gcl even though there was significant cation exchange of the sodium in the gcl with divalent cations in the tailingssoil porewater the mole fraction of sodium exchangeable sodium percentage esp decreased from 65% to 10%17% the gcl with polymerenhanced bentonite had a lower hydraulic conductivity 07 m of cover soil above the gcl and experienced less cation exchange esp decreased to 19%28% than the standard gcl the other gcl with polymerenhanced bentonite and a carrier geotextile coated with a geofilm demonstrated the best hydraulic performance regardless of the thickness of cover soil or presence of an initially uncontaminated foundation layer the presence of a foundation layer between the gcl and tailings impeded the migration of arsenic from the tailings into the gcls all gcls were serving as an effective barrier to arsenic migration
the paper sets out to explore the possibility that citizenled surveys provide a better coverage of populations and specifically of hardtoreach poorer areas than the international standardized household surveys which are the basis for many of the estimates used in assessing progress toward meeting the mdgs and will be for the sdgs this hypothesis is based on the argument that the local volunteer enumerators of citizenled surveys are likely to be more sensitive to the specificities of local population distribution and recent changes than those centrally trained; and may be more effective at reaching hardto reach groups such as those nomadic groups and those in urban slums to test the hypothesis the results of uwezo meaning capability surveys have been compared at a regional level with those of contemporaneous dhs surveys in kenya tanzania and uganda for estimates of access to water and electricity overall at national level we find that uwezo estimates for access to clean water were lower at a statistically significant level than those of dhs and these differences were statistically significant at the 001% level; in particular the dhs values were much higher in regions where there are high concentrations of nomads and of urban slums implying that the uwezo surveys catch more poverty the suggestion therefore is that citizen surveys such as uwezo provide better and more accurate coverage of the poorest of the poor using the lowest estimate of the percentage missing in urban slums and extrapolating to all developing countries there are an estimated 369 million missing from the sampling frames of standardized household surveys worldwide this has important implications for the leave no one behind appeal of the un secretary general and for the un's data revolution some suggestions are made about how to progress improved population estimates c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

water pollution is a wellknown major problem in the tai lake basin china compared to industries and domestic sewage nonpoint pollution from agriculture is more difficult to detect measure and control therefore a range of policies has been formulated among which is that of 'adjustment of the planting structure' however this policy during implementation has been used to simply convert paddy fields to dry land and food crops to cash crops more surprisingly to date no research has provided evidence that such an agricultural landuse change contributes to the reduction of agricultural nutrient pollution based on an extensive farm survey this research finds that conversion of rice paddy to dry land farming has not generated a positive effect on nutrient pollution control it is estimated that nitrogen runoff from agricultural land has increased by 11 % while phosphorus runoff has increased more than two times since landuse patterns changed as farmers are inclined to apply more fertilizer on dry land than in paddy fields however this agricultural landuse change is economically effective as landuse conversion increases the net profits of farming in a significant way it is demonstrated that compared to environmental concerns economic considerations are seen to have greater benefits after such an adjustment in the planting structure these findings have important implications for policy making by local authorities in their efforts to improve environmental management and pollution control in their territories

craving has been considered one of the core features of addiction it can be defined as the urge or conscious desire to use a drug elicited by the drug itself drugassociated cues or stressors craving plays a major role in relapse even after prolonged periods of abstinence as well as in the maintenance of drug seeking in nonabstinent addicts the circuitry of craving includes medial parts of the prefrontal cortex ventral striatal zones ventral tegmental area ventral pallidum and limbic regions interestingly the cerebellum shows reciprocal loops with many of these areas the cerebellum has been linked traditionally to motor functions but increasing evidence indicates that this part of the brain is also involved in functions related to cognition prediction learning and memory moreover the functional neuroimaging studies that have addressed the study of craving in humans repeatedly demonstrate cerebellar activation when craving is elicited by the presentation of drugrelated cues however the role of cerebellar activity in these craving episodes remains unknown therefore the main goal of this review is to provide a brief update on craving studies and the traditional neural basis of this phenomenon and then discuss and propose a hypothesis for the function of the cerebellum in craving episodes c 2017 elsevier bv all rights reserved

adult hippocampal neurogenesis is strongly impaired in alzheimer's disease ad in several mouse models of ad it was shown that adult born neurons exhibit reduced survival and altered synaptic integration due to a severe lack of dendritic spines in the present work using the appxps1 mouse model of ad we reveal that this reduced number of spines is concomitant of a marked deficit in their neuronal mitochondrial content remarkably we show that targeting the overexpression of the pro neural transcription factor neurodl into appxps1 adult born neurons restores not only their dendritic spine density but also their mitochondrial content and the proportion of spines associated with mitochondria using primary neurons a bona fide model of neuronal maturation we identified that increases of mitochondrial respiration accompany the stimulating effect of neurodl overexpression on dendritic growth and spine formation reciprocally pharmacologically impairing mitochondria prevented neurodldependent trophic effects thus since overexpression of neurodl into new neurons of appxps1 mice rescues spatial memory our present data suggest that manipulating the mitochondrial system of adult born hippocampal neurons provides neuronal plasticity to the ad brain these findings open new avenues for farreaching therapeutic implications towards neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive impairment c 2017 elsevier inc all rights reserved

multicontext systems mcss introduced by brewka and eiter are a promising way to interlink decentralized and heterogeneous knowledge contexts in this paper we propose preferential multicontext systems pmcss which provide a framework for incorporating preference over contexts in mcss in such a pmcs its contexts are divided into different strata according to the preference such that information flows only from a context to contexts in the same stratum or less preferred strata given a positive integer l the first l preferred strata of a pmcs are able to fully capture information exchange between the contexts of these strata and thus these contexts form a new pmcs called the lsection of the original pmcs we generalize the equilibrium semantics for an mcs to l < equilibria for a pmcs an l < equilibrium represents a belief state that is acceptable at least for the lsection of the given pmcs we also investigate inconsistency analysis in pmcs and related computational complexity issues c 2016 elsevier inc all rights reserved
linuxbased operating systems and runtimes os/rs have emerged as the environments of choice for the majority of hpc systems while linuxbased os/rs have advantages such as extensive feature sets and developer familiarity these features come at the cost of additional system overhead in contrast to linux there is a substantial history of work in the hpc community focused on lightweight os/rs that provide scalable and consistent performance for hpc applications but lack many of the features offered by commodity os/rs in this paper we propose to bridge the gap between lwks and commodity os/rs by selectively providing a lightweight memory subsystem for hpc applications in a commodity os/r where concurrently executing a diverse range of workloads is commonplace our system hpmmap provides lightweight memory performance transparently to hpc applications by bypassing linux's memory management layer using hpmmap hpc applications achieve consistent performance while the same local compute nodes execute competing workloads likely to be found in hpc clusters and insitu workload deployments our approach is dynamically configurable at runtime and requires no resources when not in use we show that hpmmap can decrease variance and reduce application runtime by up to 50 percent when executing a colocated competing commodity workload

endocrine disruption on aquatic wildlife is being increasingly reported and the changes in gene aromatase expression are used as indicators however natural fluctuations in brain and gonadal aromatase expression and physiological indexes have not been previously measured in a fish species jenynsia multidentata throughout a complete reproductive cycle nor the biological effects of anthropogenic inputs on these responses accordingly males were monthly collected over a year in both a reference and a contaminated site physicochemical analyses of water samples were done and reflected a strong anthropogenic impact brain aromatase fluctuates along the reproductive cycle of this species and noticeably the increase of brain gene expression begins with a 1 month delay in the contaminated site this mismatch is also evidenced for testes weight hepatosomatic index also revealed adverse effects in the polluted site in turn the alterations observed in biological responses could be affecting the reproduction of this fish species
aims: 22q112 deletion syndrome 22q112ds is a neurogenetic condition associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia previous studies have shown that negative symptoms represent the most specific clinical characteristic of psychosis in 22q112ds and are strongly associated with outcome however the psychological mechanisms associated with these symptoms in this population are poorly understood in accordance with recent conceptualizations in the field of schizophrenia the present study aims at investigating whether negative symptoms are associated with the presence of negative performance beliefs and cognitive deficits methods: thirtyfive participants with 22q112ds and 24 typically developing individuals aged between 11 and 24 years were included in the study selfreported schizotypal symptoms cognitiveperceptual paranoid negative and disorganization symptoms and dysfunctional beliefs negative performance beliefs and need for approval were assessed measures of processing speed verbal memory working memory executive functioning and face recognitionwere also extracted from a broad cognitive evaluation protocol results: adolescents with 22q112ds reported significantly higher score on the negative dimension of the schizotypal personality questionnaire than controls even when controlling for the influence of anxiety/depression and intellectual functioning negative and paranoid symptoms were associated with the severity of negative performance beliefs and lower face recognition abilities mediation analyses revealed that negative performance beliefs significantly mediated the association between face recognition and negative/paranoid symptoms conclusions: these findings suggest that negative performance beliefs and basic social cognitive mechanisms are associated with negative and paranoid symptoms in individuals with 22q112ds implications for intervention are discussed in this article
getoutthevote mailers using explicit social pressure consistently increase electoral turnout; however they often generate a negative reaction or backlash one approach to increase turnout yet alleviate backlash may be to use implicit social pressure an implicit social pressure technique that has shown promise is to display a set of eyes researchers contend eyes generate a feeling of being watched which cues subjects to act in more prosocial ways to demonstrate compliance with social norms several studies support this argument including two voter mobilization studies the technique has not been widely tested however in the political context in five randomized field experiments we test the impact on turnout of mobilization mailers using eye displays we extend previous research by testing for differences in effects between male and female eyes and across political cultures the effects are substantively and statistically weak at best and inconsistent with previous findings

understanding the hydraulic behaviour of subsurface flow bioremediation systems is a prerequisite for characterising their biogeochemical functioning yet it is often overlooked using multiple tracers in parallel considerable hydraulic insight can be gained a quantitative multitracer test was conducted at a passive coal mine water bioremediation system in the uk bowden close colliery county durham to assess its hydraulic behaviour four tracers were used: bromide br uranine nafluorescein lithium li+ and nacl the system comprises two parallel treatment streams: one receiving 3050 l min 1 of moderately acidic adit drainage and the other one 90110 l min 1 of strongly acidic spoil leachate each of these treatment streams has a separate 'raps unit' reducing and alkalinity producing system and their effluents are eventually mixed in a single aerobic wetland the raps units are downwardflow porous media with mixed substrates of limestone gravels and compost; raps i has a surface area of 1511 m 2 and raps ii 1124 m 2 the aerobic wetland 990 m2 is a basin of mineral soil planted with typha latifolia and a shallow 1550 cm water level for the two raps units residence times of 45 d and effective velocities of 0709 m h 1 were deduced in terms of tracer performance in contrast to earlier findings bromide and nafluorescein tracers were applied successfully while nacl and lithium were found to be least useful particularly during dilution events caused by intense rainfall c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
experiencing selfagency over one's own action outcomes is essential for social functioning recent research revealed that patients with schizophrenia do not use implicitly available information about their actionoutcomes ie primebased agency inference to arrive at selfagency experiences here we examined whether this is related to symptoms and/or familial risk to develop the disease fiftyfour patients 54 controls and 19 unaffected and unrelated siblings performed an agency inference task in which experienced agency was measured over action outcomes that matched or mismatched outcomeprimes that were presented before action performance the positive and negative syndrome scale panss and comprehensive assessment of symptoms and history cash were administered to assess psychopathology impairments in primebased inferences did not differ between patients with symptoms of over and underattribution however patients with agency underattribution symptoms reported significantly lower overall selfagency experiences siblings displayed stronger primebased agency inferences than patients but weaker primebased inferences than healthy controls however these differences were not statistically significant findings suggest that impairments in primebased agency inferences may be a trait characteristic of schizophrenia moreover this study may stimulate further research on the familial basis and the clinical relevance of impairments in implicit agency inferences

the plastid genome of plants is the smallest and most generich of the three genomes in each cell and the one generally present in the highest copy number as a result obtaining plastid dna sequence is a particularly costeffective way of discovering genetic information about a plant until recently the sequence information gathered in this way was generally limited to small portions of the genome amplified by polymerase chain reaction but recent advances in sequencing technology have stimulated a substantial rate of increase in the sequencing of complete plastid genomes within the last year the number of complete plastid genomes accessible in public sequence repositories has exceeded 1000 this sudden flood of data raises numerous challenges in data analysis and interpretation but also offers the keys to potential insights across large swathes of plant biology we examine what has been learnt so far what more could be learnt if we look at the data in the right way and what we might gain from the tens of thousands more genome sequences that will surely arrive in the next few years the most exciting new discoveries are likely to be made at the interdisciplinary interfaces between molecular biology and ecology
bent functions are actively investigated for their various applications in cryptography coding theory and combinatorial design as one of their generalizations negabent functions are also quite useful and they are originally defined via nega hadamard transforms for boolean functions in this paper we look at another equivalent definition of them it allows us to investigate negabent functions f on f2n which can be written as a composition of a univariate polynomial over f2n and the trace mapping from f2n to f2 in particular when this polynomial is a monomial we call f a monomial negabent function families of quadratic and cubic monomial negabent functions are constructed together with several sporadic examples to obtain more interesting negabent functions in special forms we also look at certain negabent polynomials we obtain several families of cubic negabent functions by using the theory of projective polynomials over finite fields
network security management is a big challenge for network administrators due to increasing vulnerabilities vulnerabilities are the weakness of the network and allow malicious attackers access to resources controlled by an organization to keep networks secure network administrators should be aware of all vulnerabilities through which an attacker can gain access in this paper we have considered the attack graph which describes how an attacker can compromise with the security of a network to generate the attack graph multihost multistage vulnerability analysis mulval tool is used the generated graphs by this tool are logical attack graphs these graphs are based on logical programming and based on dependencies among attack goal and configuration information we have taken two security metrics namely exploitability metric and impact metric to analyze the risk associated with the network our preliminary results suggest that the size of the network has an impact on the vulnerability of a network
the nonlinear velocitydependent rolling friction coefficient between a rigid ball and soft surface was determined by instrumenting the ball with a triaxial gyroscope and converting the spin rate to translational velocity the latter was differentiated numerically and the resulting translational acceleration was normalised to the gravitational acceleration in order to obtain the rolling friction coefficient the rolling friction coefficient between a rigid sphere and a foam surface increased with velocity and consisted of three components: a sharp increase in friction coefficient at slow velocities starting at the static rolling friction coefficient; a constant coefficient at medium velocities; and a coefficient increasing with velocity squared at higher velocities c 2013 the authors published by elsevier ltd selection and peerreview under responsibility of the school of aerospace mechanical and manufacturing engineering rmit university

water pollution with largescale and smallscale plastic litter is an area of growing concern macroplastic litter is a wellknown threat to aquatic wildlife; however the effects of microsized and nanosized plastic particles on the health of organisms are not well understood smallscale plastic particles can easily be ingested by various aquatic organisms and potentially interfere with their immune system; therefore the authors used a freshwater fish species as a model organism for nanoplastic exposure characterization of polystyrene 410 nm and polycarbonate 1587 nm nanoplastic particles psnps and pcnps respectively in plasma was performed and the effects of psnps and pcnps on the innate immune system of fathead minnow were investigated in vitro effects of psnps and pcnps on neutrophil function were determined using a battery of neutrophil function assays exposure of neutrophils to psnps or pcnps caused significant increases in degranulation of primary granules and neutrophil extracellular trap release compared to a nontreated control whereas oxidative burst was less affected the present study outlines the stress response of the cellular component of fish innate immune system to polystyrene and polycarbonate nanoparticles/aggregates and indicates their potential to interfere with disease resistance in fish populations c 2016 setac
as the variety of new social media applications are developed at an everincreasing rate the number of related potential vulnerabilities and related attack vectors are also increasing traditionally social engineering attacks have always been a major cause of concern for information security departments however the theft abuse and manipulation of personal information for malicious purposes has become even prolific since the mass adoption of social media and gaming applications by the average person largely fueled by the boom in social media and gaming applications these newly introduced and everevolving apps continue to introduce new vulnerabilities due to poor system design and coding practices and have led to a multitude of sophisticated attacks and digital crimes attacks such as malware infections ransomware session hijacking sql injection and maninthemiddle attacks have been facilitated in part by the race to developing social media platforms and applications hence more effective countermeasures and prevention techniques are introduced to detect and minimize the resulting damage and losses associated with this trend this paper presents a novel 'credentials crawling' proof of concept exploit to illustrate the ease with which such attacks can be launched the proof of concept is implemented via a stealthy application which has been implemented in part using a commercial oftheshelf application camera mouse 2011 the newly developed stealth robot uses stealth techniques to conceal itself from the intended target/victim the proposed approach enables the developed robot application to remain undetected by leading commercial antivirus solutions the developed robot has been tested in different environments with various operating systems protected by various commercial antivirus solutions the presented approach was tested on computers belonging to people from different walks of life including graduate and undergraduate students faculty and staff with their consent the initial test result demonstrates that the proposed technique is effective as a tool to assist with promoting awareness against a variety of userfocused cyberattacks especially phishing attacks
the periaqueductal gray pag has been commonly recognized as a downstream site in neural networks for the expression of a variety of behaviors and is thought to provide stereotyped responses however a growing body of evidence suggests that the pag may exert more complex modulation of a number of behavioral responses and work as a unique hub supplying primal emotional tone to influence prosencephalic sites mediating complex aversive and appetitive responses of particular relevance we review how the pag is involved in influencing complex forms of defensive responses such as circastrike and risk assessment responses in animals in addition we discuss putative dorsal pag ascending paths that are likely to convey information related to threatening events to corticohippocampalamygdalar circuits involved in the processing of fear learning finally we discuss the evidence supporting the role of the pag in reward seeking and note that the lateral pag is part of the circuitry related to goaloriented responses mediating the motivation to hunt and perhaps drug seeking behavior c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
cannabis use disorder cud cooccurs with anxiety disorders at high rates little is known about the mechanisms linking cud and anxiety disorders one theoreticallydriven perspective is that individuals withanxiety disorders may be more apt to use fsbs ie behaviors that may be effective in decreasing anxiety in the shortterm but can maintain and even exacerbate anxiety in the longterm which can perpetuate cannabis use despite cannabisrelated problems the present study tested whether fsb use explained the relation of anxiety symptom severity with cannabis quantity and related problems among 77 adults with cud and comorbid anxiety disorders seeking outpatient cud treatment results indicated that fsb frequency was significantly related to anxiety symptom severity and cannabis problem severity but not cannabis quantity anxiety symptom severity was indirectly via fsb frequency related to cannabis problem severity but not to cannabis quantity these novel findings suggest that more frequent use of fsbs may play an important role in cannabis problem severity among individuals with cud and anxiety disorders c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

despite marked progress over the past several decades convective storm nowcasting remains a challenge because most nowcasting systems are based on linear extrapolation of radar reflectivity without much consideration for other meteorological fields the variational doppler radar analysis system vdras is an advanced convectivescale analysis system capable of providing analysis of 3d wind temperature and humidity by assimilating doppler radar observations although potentially useful it is still an open question as to how to use these fields to improve nowcasting in this study we present results from our first attempt at developing a support vector machine svm boxbased nowcasting sbow method under the machine learning framework using vdras analysis data the key design points of sbow are as follows: 1 the study domain is divided into many positionfixed small boxes and the nowcasting problem is transformed into one question ie will a radar echo >35dbz appear in a box in 30min? 2 boxbased temporal and spatial features which include time trends and surrounding environmental information are constructed 3 and the boxbased constructed features are used to first train the svm classifier and then the trained classifier is used to make predictions compared with complicated and expensive expert systems the above design of sbow allows the system to be small compact straightforward and easy to maintain and expand at low cost the experimental results show that although no complicated tracking algorithm is used sbow can predict the storm movement trend and storm growth with reasonable skill
background: few authors have investigated patients' expectations from foot and ankle surgery in this study we aimed to examine relationships between patients' preoperative expectations and their demographic and clinical characteristics we hypothesized that patients with more disability and those with anxiety or depressive symptoms would have greater expectations methods: all adult patients scheduled for elective foot or ankle surgery by 1 of 6 orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons were screened for inclusion over 8 months preoperatively all patients completed the hospital for special surgery foot & ankle surgery expectations survey in addition to the foot & ankle outcome score faos short form sf 12 patient health questionnaire phq 8 generalized anxiety disorder 7item scale gad7 and pain visual analog scale vas the expectations survey contained 23 expectations categories each with 5 answer choices ranging from i do not have this expectation to complete improvement expected it was scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more expectations differences in expectations relating to numerous patient demographic and clinical variables were assessed in total 352 patients with an average age of 55 15 range 1886 years were enrolled results: expectations scores were not related to age p 36 on average women expected to achieve complete improvement more often than men p 011 variables that were significantly associated with higher expectations scores p < 05 included nonwhite race use of a cane or other assistive device and greater medical comorbidity worse function and quality of life as assessed by all faos subscales and the sf12 physical and mental components more depressive and anxiety symptoms and higher pain vas scores were associated with higher expectations scores and more expectations p < 01 for all conclusions: the results of this study may help inform surgeons' preoperative discussions with their patients regarding realistic expectations from surgery generally patients with worse function and more disability had higher expectations from surgery addressing these patients' expectations preoperatively may help improve their ultimate satisfaction with surgery level of evidence: level ii cross sectional study

background insulin sensitivity is a key function in human metabolism because it has a crucial role in the development of disease that are increasingly common in modern society impaired insulin sensitivity is an important determinant of type 2 diabetes; moreover it has been proposed as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease thus reduced insulin sensitivity is strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome which represents a cluster of metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular risk factor insulin sensitivity can be modulated by different environmental factors including dietary habits obesity especially if associated with abdominal adiposity impairs insulinsensitivity while physical activity can improve it; however the composition of the habitual diet is clearly an important regulator of this function aim to evaluate methodologies and markers that can be used to substantiate existing and potential claims of beneficial effects of foods on relevant functions connected with body fat deposition insulin sensitivity and blood glucose regulation results we have reviewed the scientific basis for existing and potential claims based not only on modifications of the target functions body fat deposition insulin sensitivity and blood glucose regulation but also on modifications of other relevant associated functions energy intake energy expenditure fat storage and oxidation lipotoxicity body fat composition inflammation oxidative stress vascular function glucose production and utilization in this context we have identified a number of markers and evaluated appropriate method to measure and validate them conclusions relevant functions contributing to overweight the metabolic syndrome and diabetes have been identified the evidence reviewed indicates that in this field the link between nutrition biological responses and diseases is clearly established therefore there is a stromg potential to develop functional food science the major gap in the evidence continues to be the lack of diet based intervention trials of sufficient duration to be relevant for affecting the natural history of these conditions
most intranasal oxytocin research to date has been carried out in men but recent studies indicate that females' responses can differ substantially from males' this randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study involved an allfemale sample of 28 women not using hormonal contraception participants viewed animations of geometric shapes depicting either random movement or social interactions such as playing chasing or fighting probe questions asked whether any shapes were friends or not friends social videos were preceded by cues to attend to either social relationships or physical size changes all subjects received intranasal placebo spray at scan 1 while the experimenter was not blinded to nasal spray contents at scan 1 the participants were scan 2 followed a randomized doubleblind design at scan 2 half received a second placebo dose while the other half received 24 iii of intranasal oxytocin we measured neural responses to these animations at baseline as well as the change in neural activity induced by oxytocin oxytocin reduced activation in early visual cortex and dorsalstream motion processing regions for the social >size contrast indicating reduced activity related to social attention oxytocin also reduced endorsements that shapes were friends or not friends and this significantly correlated with reduction in neural activation furthermore participants who perceived fewer social relationships at baseline were more likely to show oxytocininduced increases in a broad network of regions involved in social perception and social cognition suggesting that lower social processing at baseline may predict more positive neural responses to oxytocin

with the popularity of internet of things lots of resource constrained devices equipped with sensors and actuators are pervasively deployed to compose a smart environment and big data are obtainable for a system to do further analytics thus to achieve humancentric purposes one such humancentric system is a smart home which analyze big data to recognize contexts and their corresponding preferences for service configuration thus to provide contextaware services however since these big data are generated in realtime with huge amount analytics based on conventional supervised way is not desirable due to the requirement of human efforts in addition there are usually multiple inhabitants with multiple combination of contexts in a home environment and it is difficult to fully collect all these possible context combination as well as their corresponding preferences in advance therefore this paper proposes an unsupervised nonparametric analytics method with a framework for humancentric smart homes to automatically discover contexts and their corresponding service configurations and the models resulting from the proposed analytics can also be used to determine the preference for a context combination unseen before
permeable pavements are increasingly being used as urban stormwater management systems permeable pavement systems enable stormwater to infiltrate through the pavement surface and into the filter layer three common recycled construction and demolition c&d materials; crushed brick cb recycled concrete aggregate rca and reclaimed asphalt pavement rap were investigated in combination with nonwoven geotextile to assess their suitability as filter materials in permeable pavements a series of laboratory tests was undertaken to assess the geotechnical and hydraulic characteristics of the c&d materials in permeable pavement applications as a worst case scenario stormwater mixtures were prepared in the laboratory with a slightly higher than the average pollutant concentrations in stormwater runoff events occurring in urban areas constant head permeability tests were carried out to investigate the stormwater filtration capacity and clogging behaviour of c&d materials a series of hydraulic conductivity tests was also conducted to investigate the effect of variations in the properties of filter media sediment particle sizes density of the filter media and clogging effects over time this research found that the geotextile layer increases pollutant removal efficiency of the c&d materials; however has potential to cause more clogging due to continuous accumulations of sediments in a long period in terms of usage in permeable pavement filter layer c&d materials were found to have geotechnical and hydraulic properties equivalent or superior to that of typical quarry granular materials the model for urban stormwater improvement conceptualisation music was furthermore employed to predict the pollutant removal efficiency of the c&d materials and the predicted results were validated with the laboratory experiments c 2014 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the softwaredriven assistance of elderly and impaired people in their every day life requires the integration of heterogeneous devices and assistive services the lack of interoperability hampers the integration and usage of these devices and services furthermore one objective in the field of ambient intelligence and human machine interaction is the adaption of assistive services to the user 5 this is deeply rooted in the idea that the usage of ambient technologies still means a barrier for elderly and impaired people and prevents them to trust and use these technologies but as these technologies aim at supporting and not restricting elderly and impaired people a methodology is needed to overcome the barrier of using ambient assistive technologies in this paper we present an approach to a enable a simplified integration of heterogeneous devices and services by the web of things recommendation and b a lightweight aal ontology together with a rulebased engine called sherlock in order to demonstrate the advantages in representing and linking user intentions to device capabilities using semantic web technologies moreover we show how this semantic representation in the contextaware sherlock engine is used to derive user intentions by recognising device events the practical applicability of the presented approach is demonstrated in a realworld use case from the aicasys project 1 c 2016 the authors published by elsevier bv
a diversity of synthetic cathinones has flooded the recreational drug marketplace worldwide this variety is often a response to legal control actions for one specific compound eg methcathinone which has resulted in the emergence of closely related replacement based on recent trends the nitrogen atom is one of the sites in the cathinone molecule being explored by designer type modifications in this study we designed and synthesized two new synthetic cathinones 1 alphapiperidinopropiophenone pipp and 2 alphapiperidinopentiothiophenone pivt which have piperidine ring substituent on their nitrogen atom thereafter we evaluated whether these two compounds have an abuse potential through the conditioned place preference cpp in mice and selfadministration sa in rats we also investigated whether the substances can induce locomotor sensitization in mice following 7 days daily injection and challenge qrtpcr analyses were conducted to determine their effects on dopaminerelated genes in the striatum pipp 10 and 30 mg/kg induced cpp in mice but not pivt however both synthetic cathinones were not selfadministered by the rats and did not induce locomotor sensitization in mice qrtpcr analyses showed that pipp but not pivt reduced dopamine transporter gene expression in the striatum these data indicate that pipp but not pivt has rewarding effects which may be attributed to its ability to affect dopamine transporter gene expression altogether this study suggests that pipp may have abuse potential careful monitoring of this type of cathinone and related drugs are advocated

ieee 802154 is a wireless standard that specifies physical layer and media access control while focusing on lowcost and lowpower transmissions between devices making it a framework of choice for upper layers developed to address the internet of things iot however this standard offers numerous possibilities regarding network topology data transfer model and security suite it has also rapidly evolved since its initial release in 2003 this combination of factors is creating room for security issues that are left in the hands of iot architects like unknown deviations from the standard as we highlight in this paper ensuring all aspect of security is essential to broad public and industrial acceptance and thus to the growth of iot technologies in this paper we provide the necessary inputs to fully grasp the security issues behind this standard before examining all the elements that need to be investigated by auditors when assessing the level of security of a specific ieee 802154 infrastructure
one third of adult patients with orthognathic surgery of a prognathic or retrognathic mandible show relapse the sagittal split osteotomy of the mandible leads to a displacement of both parts up to 10 mm without any changes of muscle attachment changed mandible length needs adaptation of muscle capacity because of changed force to moment ratio the aim of this microarray study was to analyze the general genetic response of masseter muscle in patients with retrognathism or prognathism of the mandible six months after surgery in comparison with healthy untreated controls we found in tissue samples from masseter muscle a reduction of different entities between patients and controls but less in retrognathic than in prognathic patients 274/429 the different entities to controls in prognathia were reduced from 1862 to 1749 but increased in retrognathia from 1070 to 1563 we have to consider that the total amount of different entities to the controls is higher in patients with prognathic mandible 7364 because of their strong genetic controlled development compared with that in patients with retrognathic mandible 4126 which is more environmentally influenced it can be concluded that function follows form after surgical change with high inheritance in retrognathic patients the adaptation could be delayed or the capacity of regeneration potential is not sufficient c 2017 european association for craniomaxillofacial surgery published by elsevier ltd all rights reserved
the global increase in cultural and religious diversity has led to calls for toleration of group differences to achieve intergroup harmony although much socialpsychological research has examined the nature of stereotyping prejudice and discrimination and its impact on targets of these biases little research has examined the nature and impact of toleration for intergroup relations toleration does not require that people give up their objections to outgroup norms and practices but rather mutual accommodation integrating research from various social sciences we explore the nature of intergroup tolerance including its three components objection acceptance and rejection while drawing out its implications for future social psychological research we then explore some psychological consequences to social groups that are the object of toleration by doing so we consider the complex ways in which intergroup tolerance impacts both majority and minority groups and the dynamic interplay of both in pluralistic societies

we investigate numerically the dynamics of capillary filling and haines jump events using free energy lattice boltzmann lb simulations both processes are potentially important multiphase porescale flow processes for geological co2 sequestration and oil recovery we first focus on capillary filling and demonstrate that the numerical method can capture the correct dynamics in the limit of long times for both high and low viscosity ratios ie the method gives the correct scaling for the length of the penetrating fluid column as a function of time examining further the early times of capillary filling three consecutive length vs time regimes have been observed in agreement with available experimental work in the literature in addition we carry out simulations of haines jump events in idealised and realistic rock pore geometries we observe that the haines jump events are cooperative nonlocal and associated with both drainage and imbibition dynamics our observations show that the pore filling dynamics is controlled by the ohnesorge number associated with the balance between viscous forces and inertial / surface tension forces using this concept we are able to identify the type of pore filling dynamics that will occur c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved
jet electrochemical machining is a promising shaping method that has the potential to replace traditional sinking ecm in the industry owing to its flexibility and stability however its machining quality is impaired by the occurrence of a unique phenomenon ie the anode cannot be uniformly dissolved with high nozzle travel rate this paper aims to analyze this unique phenomenon from the viewpoint of anodic behavior and to select the optimum travel rate parameter window the anodic behavior of tb6 titanium alloy in sodium chloride solution was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry cyclic voltammetry electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry a timedependent mechanism of pitting/large localized corrosion/polishing for the anodic interface structure was developed the full electricity quantity of the equivalent oxide layer capacitor q was proposed as a criterion for the initiation of uniform dissolution state subsequently a novel model that incorporates the parameter q was developed to account for the effect of anodic behavior this model is able to predict the machined profile as well as the localized corrosion range finally the effect of nozzle travel rate on jet ecm performance was investigated and a nozzle travel rate of 10 to 25 mu m s 1 was selected as the optimum parameter window in the present work c 2017 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

estuary plumes on the western louisiana continental shelf in the gulf of mexico outside of constricted channels of the sabine and calcasieu lakes were observed on two radarsat1 synthetic aperture radar sar images the in situ data showed a change in salinity of similar to 23 psus across the front on the northwest edge of the plume corresponding to locations of vertical salinity variation of 5575 psu velocity magnitude outside of the inlet reached more than 23 ms 1 seaward and a brackish lens in the upper 45 m of the water column the spread of which contributed to the development of a plume the volume of brackish water within the plume was estimated an order of magnitude larger than the volume output from the calcasieu river within an entire ebb tidal period this implies that the plume was formed during multiple tidal cycles and it sustained during the flood tides because only weak diurnal tides exist both satellite and in situ observations showed an interesting western intensification of the plume an analysis to the momentum/vorticity equations suggests that the western intensification is due to the asymmetry of the vorticitydivergence relationship under the coriolis force this can also be enhanced by an ambient coastal current that strengthens the convergence at the front estuary plumes are shown as bright and dark features in two sar images results from a radar model simulation and in situ water temperature data showed that the sar observed plume features were dominated by the water temperature differences

the united kingdom's marriage same sex couples act 2013 was framed by the government as an equality measure and as such those who opposed the legislation were likely to be sensitive to possible accusations of prejudice this article examines opposition to marriage equality within the british press and explores how denials of homophobia were made opponents to samesex marriage attended to commonsense notions of homophobes' either by aligning their views with categories of persons not typically considered homophobic or by distancing their views from a homophobic other opponents also offered a counteraccusation that it was liberal supporters of samesex marriage who were intolerant parallels are drawn with discursive literature on racist discourse and it appears that despite social scientists' attempts to expand the concept of antigay prejudice homophobia is commonly referred to in terms of irrational bigoted individuals

the main objective of this study was to analyse the outcomes after total knee arthroplasty tka of a group of patients with at least one selfreported allergy and a group of patients without reported allergies we hypothesized there is a significant negative influence on clinical outcome scores after tka in patients with selfreported allergies fourhundred and seventyfive patients who had undergone tka were analysed preoperatively and 1 year after surgery the womac kss and sf36 scores were obtained the patients' yesavage depression questionnaire score was also recorded the scores of the 330 695 % patients without selfreported allergies were compared to the scores of the 145 305 % patients with at least one selfreported allergy in the medical record preoperative scores were similar in both groups the womac postoperative scores 236 vs 204; p 0037 and the kssknee score 911 vs 876; p 0027 were worse in the group of patients with selfreported allergies than in the group without allergies the scores from the yesavage depression questionnaire and in the sf36 were similar in both groups patients with at least one selfreported allergy have worse postoperative outcomes in terms of the womac and kssknee scores after tka than patients without allergies these poor outcomes do not seem to be related to depression therefore more research is needed to explain them reported allergies could be considered a prognostic factor and used when counselling tka patients i
in a cable in conduit conductor cicc cooled by forced circulation of supercritical helium the heat exchange in the bundle region can play a significant role for conductor safe operation while remaining a quite uncertain parameter heat exchange between bundle and jacket depends on the relative contributions of convective heat transfer due to the helium flow inside the bundle and of thermal resistance due to the wrappings between the cable and the conduit in order to qualify this thermal coupling at realistic operating conditions a dedicated experiment on a 12 m sample of iter toroidal field tf dummy conductor was designed and performed in the helios test facility at cea grenoble several methods were envisaged and the choice was made to assess bundle jacket heat transfer coefficient by measuring the temperature of a solid copper cylinder inserted over the conductor jacket and submitted to heat deposition on its outer surface the mockup was manufactured and tested in spring 2015 bundle jacket heat transfer coefficient was found in the range 300500 w m 2 k1 results analysis suggests that the order of magnitude of convective heat transfer coefficient inside bundle is closer to colburnreynolds analogy than to dittusboelter correlation and that bundle jacket thermal coupling is mainly limited by thermal resistance due to wrappings a model based on an equivalent layer of stagnant helium between wraps and jacket was proposed and showed a good consistency with the experiment with relevant values for the helium layer thickness c 2016 elsevier ltd all rights reserved

stone columns or granular column have been used to increase the load carrying capacity and accelerating consolidation of soft soil recently the geosynthetic reinforced stone column technique has been developed to improve the load carrying capacity of the stone column in addition reinforcement prevents the lateral squeezing of stone in to surrounding soft soil helps in easy formation of stone column preserve frictional properties of aggregate and drainage function of the stone column this paper investigates the improvement of load carrying capacity of isolated ordinary and geotextile reinforced sand column through field load tests tests were performed with different reinforcement stiffness diameter of sand column and reinforcement length the results of field load test indicated an improved load carrying capacity of geotextile reinforced sand column over ordinary sand column the increase in load carrying capacity depends upon the sand column diameter stiffness of reinforcement and reinforcement length also the partial reinforcement length about two to four time's sand column diameter from the top of the column was found to significant effect on the performance of sand column
this paper describes a series of reduced scale tests at unit gravity performed on circular footings supported by reinforced sand reinforcement by multiple layers of geocell was investigated and the performance of the footing was compared to one on the same sandy soil containing multilayered planar geotextile reinforcement the comparison used geocell and geotextile layers formed from the same parent geosynthetic material having the same characteristics but with a lower geocell mass results show that the efficiency of the reinforcement described in terms of the load carrying and subgrade modulus enhancement decreased as the number of layers increased in tests at moderate and low footing settlements significant improvements in bearing capacity and subgrade modulus were obtained with the application of three layers of geocell on the whole multilayered geocellreinforced soil provides a more effective and much stiffer system capable of delivering greater foundation loads and subgrade modulus than multilayered planar reinforced soil even when less parent geosynthetic material is used in the multilayered geocell arrangement furthermore reinforcement benefit is achievable at settlements as small as 0204% of the footing diameter for the geocell installations whereas settlements 4 to 5 times larger are needed before benefit is gained from a comparable planar geotextile system to achieve comparable performances the multilayered geocell requires 1/4 to 1/2 the mass of geosynthetic material as that needed for multilayered planar geotextile reinforcement depending on the settlement allowable the multi layered geocell reinforcement requires considerably less parent geosynthetic material reducing transport and perhaps supply costs and because the size of reinforcement zone required is considerably smaller the amount of excavation and backfill required is also significantly reduced c 2017 the japanese geotechnical society production and hosting by elsevier bv

hypergraph is a powerful representation for several computer vision machine learning and pattern recognition problems in the last decade many researchers have been keen to develop different hypergraph models in contrast no much attention has been paid to the design of hyperedge weighting schemes however many studies on pairwise graphs showed that the choice of edge weight can significantly influence the performances of such graph algorithms we argue that this also applies to hypergraphs hi this paper we empirically study the influence of hyperedge weights on hypergraph learning via proposing three novel hyperedge weighting schemes from the perspectives of geometry multivariate statistical analysis and linear regression extensive experiments on orl coil20 jaffe sheffield scenel 5 and caltech256 datasets verified our hypothesis for both classification and clustering problems for each of these classes of problems our empirical study concludes with suggesting a suitable hypergraph weighting scheme moreover the experiments also demonstrate that the combinations of such weighting schemes and conventional hyper graph models can achieve competitive classification and clustering performances in comparison with some recent stateoftheart algorithms c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
understanding the hydraulics around injection and production wells in unconfined aquifers associated with rainwater and reclaimed water aquifer storage schemes is an issue of increasing importance much work has been done previously to understand the mathematics associated with darcy's law in this context however groundwater flow velocities around injection and production wells are likely to be sufficiently large such as to induce significant nondarcy effects this article presents a mathematical analysis to look at forchheimer's equation in the context of water injection and water production in unconfined aquifers three different approximate solutions are derived using quasisteadystate assumptions and the method of matched asymptotic expansion the resulting approximate solutions are shown to be accurate for a wide range of practical scenarios by comparison with a finite difference solution to the full problem of concern the approximate solutions have led to an improved understanding of the flow dynamics they can also be used as verification tools for future numerical models in this context c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved

developing drilling fluids with a low solid content is preferred for better solid control easier fluid maintenance faster penetration rate and improved hydraulics in oil and natural gas exploration in this work low solid drilling fluids were prepared by replacing a certain amount of bentonite in traditional fluids with a small amount of cellulose nanoparticles cnps including cellulose nanocrystals cncs and cellulose nanofibers cnfs aiming to improve costefficiency ecofriendliness and safety of the fluids rheological and filtration properties of the fluids were investigated and compared with those of the traditional fluids without cnps the results indicated that the low solid fluids exhibited an obvious shear thinning behavior the morphology of cnps played an essential role in modifying the fluid properties the fluids with smaller cncs had lower viscosity yield point and gel strength; and the formed filter cakes had a larger porosity and lower permeability in comparison with the fluids having larger and longer cnfs these differences were attributed to the distinct cnc and cnf morphologies and their interactions with bentonite the study helps promote applications of biodegradable and renewable additives in well service fluids for oil and natural gas exploitation and production c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
to obtain quantitative information on human metabolism of selenium we have performed selenium speciation analysis by hplc/lcpms on samples of human urine from one volunteer over a 48hour period after ingestion of selenium 10 mg as sodium selenite lselenomethionine or dlselenomethionine the three separate experiments were performed in duplicate normal background urine from the volunteer contained total selenium concentrations of 830 mu g se/l n22 but depending on the chromatographic conditions only about 3070% could be quantified by hplc/icpms the major species in background urine were two selenosugars namely methyl2acetamido2deoxy1selenobetadgalactopyranoside selenosugar 1 and its deacylated analog methyl2amino2deoxylselenobetadgalactopyranoside selenosugar 3 selenium was rapidly excreted after ingestion of the selenium compounds: the peak concentrations similar to 250400 mu g se/l normalized concentrations were recorded within 59 hours and concentrations had returned to close to background levels within 48 hours by which time 2540% of the ingested selenium depending on the species ingested had been accounted for in the urine in all experiments the major metabolite was selenosugar 1 constituting either similar to 80% of the total selenium excreted over the first 24 hours after ingestion of selenite or lselenomethionine or similar to 65% after ingestion of dlselenomethionine selenite was not present at significant levels < 1 mu g se/l in any of the samples; selenomethionine was present in only trace amounts similar to 1 mu g/l equivalent to less than 05% of the total se following ingestion of lselenomethionine but it constituted about 20% of the excreted selenium first 24 hours after ingestion of dlselenomethionine presumably because the d form was not efficiently metabolized trimethylselenonium ion a commonly reported urine metabolite could not be detected <1 mu g/l in the urine samples after ingestion of selenite or selenomethionine cytotoxicity studies on selenosugar 1 and its glucosamine isomer selenosugar 2 methyl2acetamido2deoxy1selenobetadglucosopyranoside were performed with hepg2 cells derived from human hepatocarcinoma and these showed that both compounds had low toxicity about 1000fold less toxic than sodium selenite the results support earlier studies showing that selenosugar i is the major urinary metabolite after increased selenium intake and they suggest that previously accepted pathways for human metabolism of selenium involving trimethylselenonium ion as the excretionary end product may need to be reevaluated
network security is rapidly developing but so are attack methods network worms are one of the most widely used attack methods and have are able to propagate quickly as an active defense approach to network worms the honeynet technique has long been limited by the closed architecture of traditional network devices in this paper we propose a closed loop defense system of worms based on a softwaredefined networking sdn technology called wormhunter the flexibility of sdn in network building is introduced to structure the network infrastructures of wormhunter by using welldesigned flow tables wormhunter is able to easily deploy different honeynet systems with different network structures and dynamically when anomalous traffic is detected by the analyzer in wormhunter it can be redirected into the honeynet and then safely analyzed throughout the process attackers will not be aware that they are caught and all of the attack behavior is recorded in the system for further analysis finally we verify the system via experiments the experiments show that wormhunter is able to build multiple honeynet systems on one physical platform meanwhile all of the honeynet systems with the same topology operate without interference
a fully integrated lowdropoutregulated stepdown multiphaseswitchedcapacitor dcdc converter aka charge pump cp with a fastresponse adaptivephase fastrap digital controller is designed using a 65nm cmos process different from conventional designs a lowdropout regulator ldo with an nmos power stage is used without the need for an additional stepup cp for driving a clock tripler and a pulse divider are proposed to enable the fastrap control as the fastrap digital controller is designed to be able to respond faster than the cascaded linear regulator transient response will not be affected by the adaptive scheme thus lightload efficiency is improved without sacrificing the response time when the cp operates at 90 mhz with 803% cp efficiency only small ripples would appear on the cp output with the 18phase interleaving scheme and be further attenuated at vout by the 50mv dropout regulator with only 41% efficiency overhead and 65% area overhead the output ripple is less than 2 mv for a load current of 20 ma
the wienerhopf factorization of a complex function arises in a variety of fields in applied mathematics such as probability finance insurance queuing theory radio engineering and fluid mechanics the factorization fully characterizes the distribution of functionals of a random walk or a levy process such as the maximum the minimum and hitting times here we propose a constructive procedure for the computation of the wienerhopf factors valid for both single and double barriers based on the combined use of the hilbert and the ztransform the numerical implementation can be simply performed via the fast fourier transform and the euler summation given that the information in the wienerhopf factors is strictly related to the distributions of the first passage times as a concrete application in mathematical finance we consider the pricing of discretely monitored exotic options such as lookback and barrier options when the underlying price evolves according to an exponential levy process we show that the computational cost of our procedure is independent of the number of monitoring dates and the error decays exponentially with the number of grid points c 2015 elsevier bv all rights reserved
the development of trust has its origin in parenting however it can be misleading to lump together all types of trust and to suppose that they are formed through similar developmental processes therefore this research examined different developmental pathways of adolescents' trust in individuals close to them peers in this study and those that are distant politicians in this study the study used longitudinal data collected from czech adolescents n 904; 50 % of the participants were females when adolescents were 13 years old they and their parents reported parental warmth adolescents rated their trust in their parents and their beliefs in a just world at age 15 as well as their trust in peers and politicians at age 17 both maternal and paternal warmth predicted adolescents' trust in their parents which in turn led to later trust in peers but not to later trust in politicians however maternal and paternal warmth only predicted their trust in politicians through the mediation of their personal belief in a just world our findings highlighted that although parents are important in the development of adolescents' trust mediating pathways differ depending on the types of relationships involved
platelet activation has long been known to be accompanied by secretion from at least three types of compartments these include dense granules the major source of small molecules; alphagranules the major protein storage organelle; and lysosomes the site of acid hydrolase storage despite similar to 60 years of research there are still many unanswered questions about the cell biology of platelet secretion: for example how are these secretory organelles organized to support cargo release and what are the key routes of cargo release granule to plasma membrane or granule to canalicular system moreover in recent years increasing evidence points to the platelet being organized for secretion of the contents from other organelles namely the dense tubular system endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus conceivably protein secretion is a widespread property of the platelet and its organelles in this review we concentrate on the cell biology of the alphagranule and its structure/function relationships we both review the literature and discuss the wide array of 3dimensional highresolution structural approaches that have emerged in the last few years these have begun to reveal new and unanticipated outcomes and some of these are discussed we are hopeful that the next several years will bring rapid advances to this field that will resolve past controversies and be clinically relevant
this article examines face recognition as a key instance of the emergence of smart photography smart photography drawing on artificial intelligence ai and ambient intelligence ami manifests a 'habit of mind' karen barad or a way of thinking that is humanist in so far as it is predicated on human and machine autonomy and representationalist in its quest for unmediated objectsinthemselves faces are among the objects that smart photography seeks autonomously to represent by examining two of the principal algorithms of face recognition technology the article will show how ways of seeing allied to ways of thinking that are also ultimately discriminatory and essentialist materialise through software finally if the 'smart' in smart photography means learning to discriminate between classes of faces that are fixed essentialised and ultimately elusive the stereotypical face of terror is both gendered and racialised then how could smart be made smarter? this is a question of politics rather than progress
background traditionally engineering curricula about electrical circuits use textbook instruction and handson lessons which are effective approaches for teaching terms and definitions the procedural use of formulas and how to build circuits nonetheless students often lack conceptual understanding purpose hypothesis the aim of this study was to discover how to facilitate the acquisition of conceptual understanding we hypothesized that adding an instructional approach in the form of inquiry learning in a virtual lab would be more effective than relying on traditional instruction alone design/method students in secondary vocational engineering education were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in a quasiexperimental study in the traditional condition the curriculum was supplemented with computerbased practice in the virtual lab condition the traditional curriculum was supplemented with inquiry learning in a virtual lab results results showed that students in the virtual lab condition scored significantly higher on conceptual understanding cohen's d 065 and on procedural skills d 076 in particular students in this condition scored higher d 119 on solving complex problems this result occurred for both complex conceptual and procedural problems conclusion since students in the virtual lab condition acquired better conceptual understanding and also developed better procedural skills than students in the traditional condition it appears that conceptual understanding and procedural skills develop in an iterative fashion

when do children acquire a propositional attitude folk psychology or theory of mind? the orthodox answer to this central question of developmental tom research had long been that around age 4 children begin to apply belief and other propositional attitude concepts this orthodoxy has recently come under serious attack though from two sides: scoffers complain that it overestimates children's early competence and claim that a proper understanding of propositional attitudes emerges only much later boosters criticize the orthodoxy for underestimating early competence and claim that even infants ascribe beliefs in this paper the orthodoxy is defended on empirical grounds against these two kinds of attacks on the basis of new evidence not only can the two attacks safely be countered but the orthodox claim can actually be strengthened corroborated and refined: what emerges around age 4 is an explicit unified flexibly conceptual capacity to ascribe propositional attitudes this unified conceptual capacity contrasts with the less sophisticated less unified implicit forms of tracking simpler mental states present in ontogeny long before this refined version of the orthodoxy can thus most plausibly be spelled out in some form of 2systemsaccount of theory of mind
this paper presents the results of a brushless permanent magnet pm startergenerator design which caters for lowcost manufacture and a highly constrained mechanical space envelope the startergenerator design addresses the lowcost requirement through the use of aluminium winding conductors and ferrite pm this presents several challenges which include but are not limited to the selection of an appropriate machine topology to realise a high specific output with the lower performance materials minimizing the power losses associated with the higher resistivity of aluminium and the enhancement of thermal performance the problem is further exacerbated by the demanding space envelope operating requirements and the necessity of design for manufacture the selection of an appropriate machine topology is paramount in the present application as the limited mechanical spaceenvelope results in a pancake like geometry in which the aspect ratio of the stator outer diameter to the machine active length is high to provide a solution satisfying all these challenging design requirements an approach combining the theoretical electromagnetic and thermal analyses together with tests on machine subassemblies has been employed here such a method allows for a more informed design process where the manufacture and assembly nuances affecting the startergenerator's performance are identified and accounted for prior to prototyping of the complete machine assembly this paper discusses the employed design methodology in detail a number of machine designs with alternative winding constructions have been considered providing an insight into challenges and limitations for the cost effective winding construction utilizing aluminium conductors the results from analysis of the starter generator suggest that the proposed machine design is capable of achieving the design requirements for both continuous and transient operating modes

past research investigated the surpassing of mean velocity at riffle cross sections by that at pool cross sections for flows up to bankfull termed velocity reversals' to understand one mechanism by which rifflepool relief is maintained this study reenvisioned the classic velocity reversal by documenting stagedependent changes to the locations of peak velocity without cross sections instead the dynamics of peak velocity patches were considered for flows spanning 02 to 22 times bankfull discharge through the use of a highresolution dem and twodimensional hydrodynamic modelling a remarkable diversity in peak velocity patch behaviour was found across discharges including gradual expansion and shifting as well as abrupt disappearance and emergence relative to the lowflow patch locations these behaviours blended together to varying degrees to produce many reversals in peak velocity across morphological units but it took substantially higher than bankfull discharge for peak velocities to move from riffles and chutes to fast glides and pools the discharges at which reversals occurred among morphological units were significantly higher for the valleyconfined reach than for the anastomosing reach copyright c 2016 john wiley & sons ltd

background: early research has documented that young children show an increased interest toward objects that are verbally labeled by an adult compared to objects that are presented without a label it is unclear whether the same phenomenon occurs in neurodevelopmental disorders affecting social development such as autism spectrum disorder asd and williams syndrome ws methods: the present study used a novel eyetracking paradigm to determine whether hearing a verbal label increases the salience of novel objects in 35 preschoolers with asd 18 preschoolers with ws and 20 typically developing peers results: we found that typically developing children and those with ws but not those with asd spent significantly more time looking at objects that are verbally labeled by an adult compared to objects that are presented without a label conclusions: in children without asd information accompanied by the speaker's verbal label is accorded a special status and it is more likely to be attended to in contrast children with asd do not appear to attribute a special salience to labeled objects compared to nonlabeled objects this result is consistent with the notion that reduced responsivity to pedagogical cues hinders social learning in young children with asd

friction stir welding is a novel joining process extensively used for welding of aluminum alloys it is widely known that the process parameters involved in friction stir welding play a pivotal role in determining the final characteristics and microstructure of the joint however it is still unclear that what combination of process parameter values will lead to the optimum joint characteristics taguchi technique is a handy and efficient method that has been widely used for performing optimization in manufacturing engineering in this paper lap joint friction stir welding was performed on aa1100 and the process parameters were optimized using taguchi l16 orthogonal design of experiments unlike previous studies on optimization of friction stir welding process in aluminum alloys a more comprehensive approach has been taken towards the number of input and output parameters of the process process parameters considered in this study were tool rotational speed tool traverse speed tool tilt angle and tool pin shape the optimum design was obtained with reference to output parameters including hardness and grain size in the weld center zone maximum working temperature joint tensile strength and elongation as well as the vertical and horizontal forces on the tool during the process analysis of variance was additionally performed to evaluate the significance of each design parameter on output parameters results gained from analysis of variance indicated that rotational speed and traverse speed were the most critical parameters in determining the weld mechanical properties as well as quality of the weld microstructure finally to validate predicted optimum values based on taguchi technique confirmation tests were conducted where an excellent agreement was observed between the predicted and experimental values showing accuracy of the employed method and obtained results
viruses with segmented rna genomes must package the correct number of segments for synthesis of infectious virus particles recent studies suggest that the members of the reoviridae family with segmented doublestranded rna genomes achieve this challenging task by forming rna networks of segments prior to their recruitment into the assembling capsid albeit direct evidence is still lacking here we investigated the capability of virus recovery by preformed complexes of ten rna segments of epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus ehdv a reoviridae member by transcribing exact t7 cdna copies of genomic rna segments in a single in vitro reaction followed by transfection of mammalian cells the data obtained was further confirmed by rna complexes generated from bluetongue virus another family member formation of rna complexes was demonstrated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and rnarna interactions inherent to the formation of the rna complexes were demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay further we showed that disruption of rna complex formation inhibits virus recovery confirming that recruitment of complete rna networks is essential for packaging and consequently virus recovery this efficient reverse genetics system will allow further understanding of evolutionary relationships of reoviridae members and may also contribute to development of antiviral molecules
this paper examines determinants of adoption of rainwater harvesting and conservation techniques in semiarid tharaka subcounty eastern kenya given the erratic rainfall that characterises tharaka rainwater harvesting and conservation is critical for the improvement of agricultural production the study was conducted in two agroecological zones and 196 respondents were interviewed the majority of the farmers were practising between 13 and 46 rainwater harvesting and conservation techniquesan indication of the awareness of the benefits in situ technologies were more frequently practised than microcatchment and macrocatchment technologies there were institutional efforts supporting adoption of microcatchment and macrocatchment techniques in the recent past correlation results showed that the number of techniques practised was influenced by the number of years spent in school arable land size labour availability and number of livelihood options soil quality is an unlikely determinant of rainwater harvesting because a majority of the farmers rated it as good and fair chisquared results suggest that choice of rainwater techniques is primarily informed by a desire to harvest and conserve soil moisture than to improve soil quality although adoption of these technologies is encouraging assessment of their efficiency in the context of physical attributes such as soil characteristics slope and rainfall amount of the area would add value copyright c 2014 john wiley & sons ltd

in the current research we posited the stigmabyprejudicetransfer effect which proposes that stigmatized group members eg white women are threatened by prejudice that is directed at other stigmatized group members eg african americans because they believe that prejudice has monolithic qualities while most stigma researchers assume that there is a direct correspondence between the attitude of prejudiced individuals and the targets ie sexism affects women racism affects racial minorities the five studies reported here demonstrate that white women can be threatened by racism study 1 3 4 and 5 and men of color by sexism study 2 robust to perceptions of liking and the order in which measures were administered results showed that prejudice transfers between racism and sexism were driven by the presumed social dominance orientation of the prejudiced individual in addition important downstream consequences such as the increased likelihood of anticipated stigma expectations of unfair treatment and the attribution of negative feedback to sexism appeared for stigmatized individuals
currently increasing importance has been attached to heavy metal pollution of water environment in order to help geologist and environmentalist to obtain onsite experimental data there is an urgent need to develop portable analysis techniques of water quality which can be used to give an timely and accurate assessment of water quality of the contaminated area with low cost and to monitor water environment conveniently in daily preventing and controlling work of water pollution based on adsorption with purolite s930 chelating resin at ph 4 and thinfilm sample preparation technique a rapid and simple onsiteoriented analysis method of heavy metal ions namely mn fe ni cu zn and pb in aqueous solutions was developed utilizing a handheld energydispersive xray fluorescence in this paper the correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were greater than 0 992 for all six metal ions the lower limits of detection were between 5 8 and 18 6 mu g l1 precision tests carried out on multielement mixed solutions showed that the relative standard deviations rsd n10 were better than 15% the method has been used onsite to analysis 21 water samples collected from different river or well sites near a mining area northeast china out of the five underground water samples one was found contaminated by cu and zn class id one by zn and fe class i and one by fe in between class ii to iii surface water samples showed better qualities but two out of the sixteen were found to be contaminated by mn heavily class iv laboratory icpms was used to analyze the same samples the results for cu ni and pb were coincident with the onsite data in general but for zn and mn with higher concentrations onsite data were lower than that by icpms the reason for that might be the inclusion of the fine suspending particles in the samples by icpms we conclude that the onsite data were effective with the described method an overall data acquisition time including sampling processing and measuring can be within 12 hours for a batch of 10 samples the preconcentration device and the xrf instrument are both small light portable and can operate without external power supply so the method is suitable for onsite water sample analysis especially in remote areas
detecting where our partners direct their gaze is an important aspect of social interaction an atypical gaze processing has been reported in autism however it remains controversial whether children and adults with autism spectrum disorder interpret indirect gaze direction with typical accuracy this study investigated whether the detection of gaze direction toward an object is less accurate in autism spectrum disorder individuals with autism spectrum disorder n33 and intelligence quotientsmatched and agematched controls n38 were asked to watch a series of synthetic faces looking at objects and decide which of two objects was looked at the angle formed by the two possible targets and the face varied following an adaptive procedure in order to determine individual thresholds we found that gaze direction detection was less accurate in autism spectrum disorder than in control participants our results suggest that the precision of gaze following may be one of the altered processes underlying social interaction difficulties in autism spectrum disorder
nonverbal expressions of pride convey status but pride displays can be interpreted as either authentic or hubristic given negative stereotypes about blacks we hypothesized that when displaying pride blacks would be rated higher in hubristic and lower in authentic pride compared to whites contrary to predictions three experiments found consistent evidence that whites are judged to be more hubristic than blacks when displaying pride this effect occurred when pride was displayed in an unspecified study 1 academic study 2 or workrelated context study 3 effects were largely specific to pride displays and not a function of a general racebased response bias we speculate that these counterintuitive findings might reflect a negative reaction to those with high status flaunting their success
human action recognition har is a core technology for humancomputer interaction and video understanding attracting significant research and development attention in the field of computer vision however in uncontrolled environments achieving effective har is still challenging due to the widely varying nature of video content in previous research efforts trajectorybased video representations have been widely used for har although these approaches show stateoftheart har performance for various datasets issues like a high computational complexity and the presence of redundant trajectories still need to be addressed in order to solve the problem of realworld har in this paper we propose a novel method for har integrating a technique for rejecting redundant trajectories that are mainly originating from camera movement without degrading the effectiveness of har furthermore in order to facilitate efficient optical flow estimation prior to trajectory extraction we integrate a technique for dynamic frame skipping as a result we only make use of a small subset of the frames present in a video clip for optical flow estimation comparative experiments with five publicly available human action datasets show that the proposed method outperforms stateoftheart har approaches in terms of effectiveness while simultaneously mitigating the computational complexity c 2016 elsevier bv all rights reserved
background/aim: gesturing plays an important role in social behavior and social learning deficits are frequent in schizophrenia and may contribute to impaired social functioning information about deficits during the course of the disease and presence of severity and patterns of impairment in firstepisode patients is missing hence we aimed to investigate gesturing in first compared to multipleepisode schizophrenia patients and healthy controls methods: in 14 firstepisode patients 14 multipleepisode patients and 16 healthy controls matched for age gender and education gesturing was assessed by the comprehensive test of upper limb apraxia performance in two domains of gesturing imitation and pantomime was recorded on video raters of gesture performance were blinded results: patients with multiple episodes had severe gestural deficits for almost all gesture categories performance was worse in multiplethan in firstepisode patients firstepisode patients demonstrated subtle deficits with a comparable pattern conclusions: subjects with multiple psychotic episodes have severe deficits in gesturing while only mild impairments were found in firstepisode patients independent of age gender education and negative symptoms the results indicate that gesturing is impaired at the onset of disease and likely to further deteriorate during its course c 2016 s karger ag basel

what sorts of trait information do people most care about when forming impressions of others? recent research in social cognition suggests that warmth broadly construed should be of prime importance in impression formation yet some prior research suggests that information about others' specifically moral traitstheir moral charactermay be a primary dimension although warmth and character have sometimes been conceived of as interchangeable we argue that they are separable and that across a wide variety of contexts character is usually more important than warmth in impression formation we first showed that moral character and social warmth traits are indeed separable studies 1 and 2 further studies that used correlational and experimental methods showed that as predicted in most contexts moral character information is more important in impression formation than is warmth information studies 26 character information was also more important than warmth information with respect to judgments of traits' perceived fundamentalness to identity their uniquely human quality their contextindependence and their controllability study 2 finally study 7 used an archival method to show that moral character information appears more prominently than warmth information in obituaries and more strongly determines the impressions people form of the individuals described in those obituaries we discuss implications for current theories of person perception and social cognition

peripheral neuronal activation by inflammatory mediators is a multifaceted physiological response that involves a multitude of regulated cellular functions one key pathway that has been shown to be involved in inflammatory pain isgq/gpcr whose activation by inflammatory mediators is followed by the regulated response of the cation channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 trpv1 however the mechanism that underlies trpv1 activation downstream of the gq/gpcr pathway has yet to be fully defined in this study we employ pharmacological and molecular biology tools to dissect this activation mechanism via perforatedpatch recordings and calcium imaging of both neurons and a heterologous system we showed that trpv1 activity downstream of gq/gpcr activation only produced a subdued current which was noticeably different from the robust current that is typical of trpv1 activation by exogenous stimuli moreover we specifically demonstrated that 2 pathways downstream of gq/gpcr signaling namely endovanilloid production by lipoxygenases and channel phosphorylation by pkc converge on trpv1 to evoke a tightly regulated response of importance we show that only when both pathways are acting on trpv1 is the inflammatorymediated response achieved we propose that the requirement of multiple signaling events allows subdued trpv1 activation to evoke regulated neuronal response during inflammation kumarr hazan a geron m steinberg r livni l matzner h priel a activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 by lipoxygenase metabolites depends on pkc phosphorylation
using nonwoven polypropylene geotextile a filtration unit was designed for portable prototype filter capable of defluoridation and desalination the filtration unit contains geotextile bag filled with mica and graphite sand emphasis was given to make the filter design as simple as possible that is suitable for rural areas the designed filter was continuously tested for three months along with ceramic candle filter and pureit filter for comparative studies the performance of the filters was evaluated on the basis of the percentage of residue removed by the individual filters and cleaning period of the filters the results of the improvement in the water quality made by prototypes filter without cleaning show reduction in concentration of fluoride and electrical conductivity ec by 8306 and 4575% respectively while the other two filters despite weekly cleaning shows reduction in concentration of fluoride and ec by 7420 and 3004% ceramic filter and 9368 and 8637% pureit filter respectively the prototype filter with very simple in design has performed better than other filters with complex designs the test shows that uses of nonwoven geotextiles polypropylene along with sand can provide an alternate solution to the expensive defluoridation and desalination processes
supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems have become a salient part in controlling critical infrastructures such as power plants energy grids and water distribution systems in the past decades these systems were isolated and use proprietary software operating systems and protocols in recent years scada systems have been interfaced with enterprise systems which therefore exposed them to the vulnerabilities of the internet and the security threats traditional security solutions eg firewalls antivirus software and intrusion detection systems cannot fully protect scada systems because they have different requirements this paper presents an innovative intrusion detection approach to detect scada tailored attacks this is based on a datadriven clustering technique of process parameters which automatically identifies the normal and critical states of a given system later it extracts proximitybased detection rules from the identified states for monitoring purposes the effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested by conducting experiments on eight data sets that consist of process parameters' values the empirical results demonstrated an average accuracy of 98% in automatically identifying the critical states while facilitating the monitoring of the scada system
a generalized partialelement equivalentcircuit peec method is proposed for modeling a planar circuit with a thin narrow slot on the ground the approach is based on the coupled mixed potential integral equations for a problem with mixed electric and magnetic currents the coupled integral equations are converted into a lumpedelement circuit network using kirchhoff's voltage law and kirchhoff's current law of the circuit theory the fullwave green's functions for a grounded dielectric substrate problem are used the interactions between electric current on a microstrip line and magnetic current on a slot are taken into account by introducing two kinds of controlled sources this generalized peec model will be very useful in signalintegrity analysis for multilayered circuits to validate the generalized model three numerical examples consisting of microstrip lines and slots on the ground are presented the results obtained by the proposed generalized peec model are compared with those obtained by commercial electromagnetic simulation software and published experimental results good agreement is obtained
the raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides has a wide distribution in europe and is a prominent example of a highly adaptable alien species it has been recorded sporadically in denmark since 1980 but observations since 2008 suggested that the species had established a freeranging selfsustaining population to elucidate the origin and genetic patterns of danish raccoon dogs we studied the population genomics of 190 individuals collected in denmark n 141 together with reference captive individuals from poland n 21 and feral individuals from different european localities germany poland estonia and finland n 28 we used a novel genotypingbysequencing approach simultaneously identifying and genotyping a large panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms n 4526 overall there was significant indication for contemporary genetic structuring of the analysed raccoon dog populations into at least four different clusters in spite of the existence of long distance gene flow and secondary admixture from different population sources the danish population was characterized by a high level of genetic admixture with neighbouring feral european ancestries and the presence of private clusters nonretrieved in any other feral or captive populations sampled these results suggested that the raccoon dog population in denmark was founded by escapees from genetically unidentified danish captive stocks followed by a recent admixture with individuals migrating from neighbouring germany
previous studies have suggested that realtime person perception relies on continuous competition in which partially active categories smoothly compete over time here two studies demonstrated the involvement of a different kind of competition in study 1 before participants selected the correct sex category for morphed faces their mouse trajectories often exhibited a continuous attraction toward the incorrect category that increased with sexcategory ambiguity indicating continuous competition on other trials however trajectories initially pursued the incorrect category and then abruptly redirected toward the correct category suggesting early incorrect category activation that was rapidly reversed later in processing these abrupt category reversals also increased with ambiguity in study 2 participants were presented with faces containing a sextypical or sexatypical hair cue in a context in which the norm was either sextypical targets normative context or sexatypical targets counternormative context sexatypical targets induced greater competition in the normative context but sextypical targets induced greater competition in the counternormative context together these results demonstrate that categorizing others involves both smooth competition and abrupt category shifts and that these flexibly adapt to the social context
